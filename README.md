# Implementation of a sentiment analysis system from Youtube Video comments with traditional Machine Learning algorithms, TF-IDF Bag of words approaches to predict new comments sentiments and Neural networks method

We have applied different pre-processing steps to prepare the data. Such as tokenization, emoji and punctuation removal, Stemming. We have experimented with different feature combinations like TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, N-gram. We then did the classification with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour to find out which model has better performance.

### We used comments from [Jurassic World Dominion - Official Trailer [HD]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb5ELWi-ekk&t=2s&ab_channel=UniversalPictures) for creating our dataset for this system.
