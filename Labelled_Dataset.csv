Negative ,Nice trailer but script is🤮. Stop ruining classics.
Neutral ,They were extinct for a reason
Negative ,This movie is a fucking train wreck.
Negative ,some of the actors in this aren't fit for the roles at all

Positive ,An adventure 65 million and 29 years in the making. I can't begin to describe how much this franchise means to me. It's been with me ever since my childhood.
Negative ,So trash this movie. Fooled us all with the trailer.
Negative ,The new Jurassic movies suck so bad
Positive ,the music wow

Neutral ,“Life will find a way”
Neutral ,"Some of the dinosaur scenes were spot on in many ways, but as a whole the movie felt like watching nothing and the plot was abysmal."
Positive ,This movie was amazing I dont care what people say about it its amazing and I love it the only bad thing is that they dont explain why Biosyn made the locusts in the first place

Negative ,I could never get over the hand controlling “hey calm down what did I say!!!” To the dinosaurs… they lost me on that
Negative ,How can you out run a raptor🦖

Neutral ,I didnt know blue would have young in this movie
Negative ,After about the 2nd movie they’ve become stupid

Negative ,I get the feeling this movie is made by hollywood socialists. Its really a hopeless thriller compared to the old ones.
Negative ,"Great effects, great sound, good actors but the story was disappointing and weak"

Negative ,I fell asleep watching this it was boring as hell

Positive ,"This movie should definitely win an *Oscar* for ""Best Visual Effects"", they are top notch here!) 🔥"
Positive ,I actually found it entertaining and people disappointed with it went in thinking it would be something else . It's entertaining and that's all that matters in this type of movie !
Negative ,These movies are the equivalent of a 2.5 hour long fast food commercial
Negative ,That was funny😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Negative ,This was the worst movie ever seen. Just one big propaganda documentary
Negative ,"Again, Americans with perfect video quality, high budget but trash scenario"

Negative ,Chris Pratt is such a terrible over dramatic actor.He just looks like he’s trying too hard and makes it cringe.
Negative ,I guess JP3 isn't the worse movie out of all of them now seeing as this one exists

Negative ,Is this a movie or a documentary after a hour a swith off
Negative ,such an awful movie. atrocious stuff... shameful that anyone could make such a steaming pile of Dino dung..... this is literally only fit for the bin
Negative ,Why did it feel like a dummed-down version of all the Jurassic movies combined? This is literally the most sleepy movie I've seen...
Negative ,Corny and distinctly average.
