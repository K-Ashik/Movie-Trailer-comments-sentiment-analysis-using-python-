"This movie was lit garbage. All over the place, cheesy, weak character development, no purpose. Dinosaurs all over the city and the story line is about a locust infestation. At least I think that was the main goal. The first 2 were awesome and this was one sad way to end the trilogy."
Dinosaurs died 66 million years ago but they are alive in the 19s!?
"The only thing I disliked about this movie is that the cgi is a little hard to know 
Evening when those dinosaurs were running at 0:01"
Looks real lame one go spend the money on this one now

The originals were good I just can’t get into these movies. Don’t see how anyone can stand to watch them
THIS SUCKED. WAS HOPING 4 MORE.
I'm back and unimpressed. The film is the second worse In the franchise.
What timeline did a jump to?? I remember waiting for 2023 for this movie to be released this past summer 😳
The worst part of this are the dinosaurs thriving in the winter snow.
"2:30
The face... it scares me..."
Baby blue
"*A video that is impossible not to watch, I love the dinosaurs and bars in this video. Above all, I have a dinosaur in real life, If you like it, I'll watch it for fun!!!*"
WOW
All thanks to Michael crichton
"This movie was amazing. It was well thought out, and the visuals were stunning. A great way to end the trilogy"
All Jurassic Park movies belong to Sam Neil... Nobody can do this better than him
Wow did this movie ever blow.
going watch
"Why did  other people hate dinosaurs, their good why don't we their lives, their self nobody feed them😭
Now they don't exist let's grow up becoming a scientist let's bring them back to life!♥︎"
Those raptor sounds are really getting old. Jeez come on where are the good movies? New Jurassic park is crappy compared to the first one.
"Coming back to this trailer, this looked amazing. Sadly the movie was quite disappointing, Locusts? I mean what about a dinosaur army being made in America, like that would've continued the storyline of dinosaurs being equipped for military."
Bad movie
"After watching this movie a few times (including the extended version) since its release in June, I realize how much of an unexpected difference the movie was compared to what was promised in this trailer, but I’m thinking that the “coexistence” of humans and dinosaurs- as what was given at the end of the movie- would be something not fully connected because let’s say that IF more Jurassic movies come out, something could change drastically that could prove to be more than what fans were expecting to see in this final installment"
"From the moment the trailer first started I hated it, the only reason I want to watch it is because of the old cast. Growing up as a boy I was a huge Jurassic park and dinosaur fan, but this movie disappoints dinosaurs riding with humans in horseback? Just bring back the original formula, the original movies were action adventure horror movies, this feels more like science fiction now. Just can’t wrap my head around them, I guess they are trying to appeal to kids for the film but I was a kid for the originals and had no problem with the serious violence that’s what made it a great film."
hey kids skip this turkey. you are better off going back to your drag queen story hour
or would you like to take this up with tom
a trumpet dinosaur
"This trailer was beautiful, from the music to the shots. It's just a colossal disappointment that the movie was not at all what the trailer promised us. It's becoming an apparent problem with Hollywood nowadays where trailers are better than the actual movie. I've been a Jurassic fan for years but this was by far the biggest letdown we've received all year which is a pure shame when Dominion could've been so much more."
"The only marks I can give this is, it is a bigger load of rubbish than the one before it."
"Didn't enjoy it, goes to long."
It's so funny how only white people in this movie are truly one dimensional evil people.
cant wait for Jurassic park : Chicxulub
Nice trailer but script is🤮. Stop ruining classics.
They were extinct for a reason
This movie is a fucking train wreck.
some of the actors in this aren't fit for the roles at all
"A few good moments, above average action and infusion of several characters with justice done in terms of screen presence. It’s definitely not a bad movie, you can watch it with family."
Anyone watching this in 2023?
An adventure 65 million and 29 years in the making. I can't begin to describe how much this franchise means to me. It's been with me ever since my childhood.
So trash this movie. Fooled us all with the trailer.
"This movie made me realize how amazing Fallen Kingdom was

EDIT: I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this movie"
The new Jurassic movies suck so bad
the music wow
The us and the world should find a way to bring back Dino's I should love to live with Dino's
"Life will find a way, but will not find feathers"
Honestly they should’ve gone with the 3 hour version part 1 and part 2 to give this film a decent ending… this movie shows you “new dinosaurs” without telling you that some of the new Dino’s will only appear in 1 minute of the film… like the red raptor… lmao… it seemed so epic and new and fresh and bang… literally the only screen time that it got was the same scene you are watching on the trailer.. and don’t get me started on the Gigantosaurus poor innocent animal…. For the first time in the franchise… the giganotosaurus was the only innocent character in all the movie… he didn’t kill NO ONE… he was chilling minding his own business and then bang… my nigga gets drafted into a fight that wasn’t even his and my nigga die… poor guy… he didn’t deserve such a lame screen play such a lame ending such a rushed movie… Jesus Christ… even harry fucking potter had a better ending than this shit; AND I HATE HARRY POTTER
I want a refund and a memory eraser. Please
This movie is a rotten tomato and rotten egg salad. How did this happen 😳😳😳
Poachers in a world filled with dinosaurs as pest. Wtf is this shitty f movie
22 minutes now. Shoot me know. Two dinosaurs bone doctors thinking they know bugs lol 😂😂😂😂😂😆
10 minutes in and everything so far sucks. No punch no purpose. Lame ... Very lame.i want my 24.99 from Amazon back. Just no back bone
"I have to say, it really feels strange that the story is about some screwed up locusts and the dinosaurs are a little inconvenience here and there . Velociraptor Blue getting the infant back in the end, like what the heck is that supposed to be, grand finale? This movie is the biggest letdown I have seen in the franchise. Bringing Sam Neill back and limiting him to this kind of role? All in all you get the feeling this is not even a proper story, it's a clueless collection of bits and pieces that won't work. What on Earth has happened to writers and directors? Is this the best they can come up with, for goodness sake, have a look at the original movie and think for a while."
"Watched it last night. Wow, did this movie suck! Crichton's grave has (hopefully) been shat on for the last time. It took over an hour to get the two casts together, and the characters have all been so completely rewritten that they aren't even the same people. The only person who was at all interesting was Female Han Solo. This movie was just a bunch of loud noise. All flash, no substance.
And to think people thought the talking Raptor in the 3rd movie was the low point in the franchise..."
“Life will find a way”
"You messed up the dvd! If I were to buy the dvd, I want the Extended version on dvd. You don't have the Extended version on dvd. How can I buy the Extended version on dvd if you don't sell it. That is a big dilemma. You messed up badly. Why do you assume everyone has a stupid Blu-Ray player? 

I guess the only answer is I will save my money so thank you Universal for not selling something I want. I get to give my money to someone else instead of you - Universal. Another failure by Universal Pictures."
"Some of the dinosaur scenes were spot on in many ways, but as a whole the movie felt like watching nothing and the plot was abysmal."
This movie was amazing I dont care what people say about it its amazing and I love it the only bad thing is that they dont explain why Biosyn made the locusts in the first place
"To support these other commenters, the acting was terrible, I guess when a studio has 100's of millions in the budget, the directors/producers got lazy and didn't retake certain scenes or rewrite part of the script.....hire me next time, I'll do a better job writing the script and I have no experience."
How abought this watched the first hour. It sucks!!!! Who wrote the storyline. You bring back the stars and give us a piece of shit.
I'm grateful that the movie didn't get banned
Better when I saw fallen kingdom in 2018
My favorite dinosaur is a T-Rex
Good movie
Worst jurassic movie I've ever seen
"An @african thing with 5 hours to put on her fake wig, nails, eyelashes, cocoa butter AND fake everything , every day when hunting Dinosaurs is so realistic. WOKE $HIT. Probably why is made a 250 million loss. This type of thing doesnt care abou anything but its next wig."
"Why does the african wear wigs, fake nails, fake eyelashes and layers of make up? Surely hunting down Dinosaurs doesnt require these things. Why couldnt she go wigless, no false nails, no false eye lashes, no lipstick. Is she embarassed about the way she REALLY looks? I want to see a Real picture of her. She didnt even break one fake nail or loose her wig. Answers please."
Worst movie ever 😅🤦‍♂️
God this movie was awful
I could never get over the hand controlling “hey calm down what did I say!!!” To the dinosaurs… they lost me on that
Adha water
"Biggest mistake this franchise made was moving away from Action THRILLER,  and becoming an action adventure. I miss holding my breath and feeling my heart racing the way the trex water scene and raptors in the kitchen scene did. This movie is the opposite. Now it’s riding around on motorcycles with raptors like what😂😂😭😭😭"
"I saw this movie yesterday and it was so unmemorable that I’ve already forgotten what it was about. They should have spent the millions of money that went into the production of this mediocre sequel, and made something original."
"I waited patiently for this to come out, love dinosaurs , love the rest of series, but then to end it with this movie, the worst movie graphics I've ever seen , might have been better with clay mation, obviously this must have been a joking way to end it or something , but I ,for one, was appalled.   Just very wrong"
"The first time I saw the trailer of this movie, and before I saw the whole movie, I thought the black woman was Kelly, Ian Malcom's daughter, as an adult."
How can you out run a raptor🦖
"I saw this movie in theaters back on June and to be honest, This already became my new favorite movie in the whole franchise, I felt so nostalgic seeing Alan and Ellie back, Blue with a hatchling of her own, and all the new dinosaurs we all finally got to see in a Jurassic Park movie, I have been a Jurassic Park fan ever since 2012 and I’m now kind of depressed to hear the franchise is over, Thank you Trevorrow and Spielberg for making this my childhood, The Jurassic Park franchise will always be one of my all time favorite movie franchises. ❤️🦖🦕"
Dinosaurs are impactful when they are portraited as killing giants rather than presenting them as pets and running around our cities. To be honest I didn't liked it
i didnt know blue would have young in this movie
After about the 2nd movie they’ve become stupid
keating
ok?
that's just gonna be it
I think they are on somekinda drugs to make such a stupid script.  4/10
I like the first movies they are realistic compared to this crap. I wanna see it but also not. dinosaurs in snow jesus..
Awful viewing. Locusts the main story line ffs
After watching this movie i hope they never make another one! This movie sucked!
"Worst movie, that i've seen, for a long time👎🤮"
What a complete disappointment to what was an amazing franchise.
1:56 fnaf reference💀💀
"After seeing on Amazon prime , regret why i didnt watch in theatre..this movie is not bad as the critics and audience rated..first 20 mins was slight slow..but later it wS good..enjoyable"
Putting the old cast back on the screen? They really be bringing dinos back to life.
I get the feeling this movie is made by hollywood socialists. Its really a hopeless thriller compared to the old ones.
"Great effects, great sound, good actors but the story was disappointing and weak"
"When I was a kid I used to be scared, amazed, and moreover entertained by Jurassic Park and The lost world, Colin Trevorrow just fucked up what could have been an epic ending for the franchise, I mean a Jurassic locust is your main menace? Goddamn thats the most boring plot you could ever fucking imagine... Fuck these cunts who ruined our childhood"
"Its horrible movie,,,storyline is horrible my goodness......just like the ending of the 2nd last Jurrasic movie....letting the dinosaurs to roam the planet once again really??,,yeah they all didn't think what was gonna happen to the food chain?? ecosystem?? and the little dies and becomes a clone?? holy !@#$ C'mon man..I had to get it to complete the franchise"
"This trailer was good. The movie? Not so much.... I am so disappointed and heartbroken that this dumpster fire ""World"" trilogy is the way the Jurassic film series ends."
Terrible film. They need to leave classics alone and let them be
Don`t pay to watch this movie... It`s shit
I love Jurassic world
At some points I thought I was watching  mission impossible
Stop
Wasted potential after watching the movie. Sad this franchise went out this way.
This is stupid
Awful movie
They can’t live in the cold their cold blooded I’m confused.
Sad for missing spinosaurus😥
ARK: survival evolved
"Watched this movies and loved every moment of it. Still cant belive such low rating by imbd and rotten tomatoes. People are simply dont know what they want anymore. Great cgi, awesome acting, great storyline, what else do u people need."
I guess this is the final chapter of Jurassic World.
Good
"Now would be a good time to search for dino tracks in the stones that have been exposed. 

If the Mississippi was this low during the age of the dino, dinosaurs would have crossed over the stones as they migrated to new lands."
"Hi everyone, I heard this is not the end of Jurassic franchise. They teased of Jurassic Era, Kayla, Hammond, New World, Jurassic Deep and Jurassic Era 2. Is this true or false??? Please let me know. My family loves watching dinosaur movies"
This shit is about as good as Dragon Ball Evolution
All they did was add a bunch of female MC's; kill zero MC's due to that; add some bs human clone story without giving her any powers which was pointless; and then make the main boss an army of crop-eating *locusts* .....
"It can't end like this, the moving was so lackluster.."
I own the nfts of this movie the T-rex and raptors animated just like the movie with the noice and movement
Blue has a baby dinosaur. So cute
"Me when I watch the trailer YES SIR!!!!!!!
And this is me when I watch this 😐 why"
This was actually decent. Shocked me since none have been good since the first. 2hrs & 40minutes though for some fake cgi dinosaurs is way too long.
"Watched Jurassic World Dominion last night and I have to say after all the build up it was a bit disappointing. The script was weak, the dinosaurs except for a few scenes were not up too par and the large grasshoppers just didn't cut it. I guess I expected to be amazed by this great franchise one more time........ Sorry to say that just didn't happen."
I'm not even half way through the movie and I'm ready to turn it off. This isn't a JP movie.
"Sorry guys but old is gold man …..first jurassic park is the best …❤
current movies are just to make money….like this movie 💵"
I fell asleep watching this it was boring as hell
Owen: it’s a me a mario
the first 3 for me will always be the best . the first FAF were the best as well. same with the terminator. it seems after 3 it goes down hill . 3 is the lucky number.
"Сорян но в этот раз русский динозавр заборит американского, а китайский поможет но не тирексу ;) 
_если решите быковать_ 😘"
"The only scene I liked was the velociraptors chasing Chris Pratt on the motorbike. Everything else was abismal. Disappointing was an understatement. It has me laughing at the parts that _weren't_ supposed to be funny & the rest of the time I was rolling my eyes, cringing & predicting scenes. Way to kill a franchise & leave a bad taste in people's mouths. Bad acting, silly, convoluted plot, terrible script, cheesy one liners, he worst new characters... I didn't like how there was never any real risk, either... overkill on the amount of scenes they're ""in danger"" but ALWAYS end up safe. They needed to kill more characters. 1/10. Insufferable viewing experience. 😒🤦🏼‍♂️"
01:19
No way
I think the Jurassic series of films should have went the way of the dinosaurs after the third one.
"There's something about strong female character roles .
Abd there's something about female power trippers that is vile."
"The little clone girl gotta mouth on her.
Kids attitudes are f-ing garbage in this day and age. A long with being weak, and without honor."
"0:48 we thought you were talking about Blue, no one gave a damn about that kid"
"It's incredible how humiliated T. Rex is by other carnivores... In this movie. In reality, t. Rex would have slaughtered everything in its path. In fact, the subject of this film, if you have noticed, is coexistence. Typical of the hollywood ggays. How stupid are the scenes with the mosasaur swimming next to a whale, when in reality the whale would have been torn to pieces immediately. Archeopteryx flying with ordinary birds... When in reality the birds would have been eaten immediately. Sodom's propaganda is: coexistence. But Christians will not accept ties to sin."
"There are no old labors in filmmaking. full virtual effect. Green screen. CGI come on! LOOK AT HOW ARTIFICIAL THE CONTACT OF PEOPLE AND DINOSAURS WITH THE GROUND REMAIN ON THE STREETS IN THE LAND. Lately, fast fiction, fast-paced subjects leave nothing in the minds. When I watched it again, I get cut off by saying that."
Kind of getting tired of seeing Andy Dwyer and anything
The MF in the water that only do cameos is still the strongest of them all.
"This series is a candidate to become more and more crappy, just like the jaws and alien and rocky and starwars series.The players returned to the dinosaur, but the story did not end. Participants?."
"After Jurassic, there is Cretaceous"
"The movie was awful and boring
Jurrasic World has become too much of a kid friendly movie. There was nothing scary or teeth clenching about the movie.
The dinosaurs are no longer the villain. They have transformed all the dinosaurs into human friendly species.
The reason why I Love Jurassic Park 1 and 2 was because the dinosaurs were very brutal and merciless. In the first 2 movies they never censored the dinosaurs eating humans. All humans both kids and adults were victims to the dinosaurs. In JWD unfortunately the dinosaurs were just fighting among themselves ignoring who the humans were. I expect dinosaur movies to be as gruesome as zombie movies not some boring romantic flick of some elder couples kissing or the pampering of a young girl.
The movie was not scary at all it's just too kid friendly. Even the villain guy looked too weak. I don't recall him doing anything seriously evil that makes him a villain. If you want to put a serious villain then put a real evil character like Negan from The Walking Dead. The reason why this movie is just boring is because all the good guys survive at the end. The dinosaurs were no longer the dinosaurs that they should be. The uncensored gruesome merciless man eating dinos from JP1 and 2 did not exist because the movie has been designed not to scare little kids. Never again."
"So freaking lame...the usual woke bs.  The bad guys in Dominion's beginning are all driving pickups, lol.  Yeah, those pickup drivers are all evil, right?  The main ""poacher"" (Hollywood loves that word) has a southern accent (of course).  Then there is the politically motivated obsession with diversity...its so obvious, its laughable.  Then dumb things like a woman who uses  a laser to designate human targets for her raptors while she is standing 10 feet from them...wouldn't it just be and faster to shoot them?  How about the fact that every single bad person in the movie is a white male?  Why...racism?  Other dumb things: an ejection seat in a cargo airplane, lol.  Sorry, those do not exist, especially in a 1950's  C-119!  Then the heroes have to cross ice cracking beneath their feet...instead of lying down to distribute weight over a large surface area, Hollywood has them walk, lol.  Hollywood is a joke.  Don't waste your money.  You have a be a moron to like this movie."
Physics my friend physics
Just incase you didn't notice clair has a real physics issues she chased by a flying dinassuce and in a muddy situation poor bitch
Special effects and new creatures are great…..could have avoided all of the woke cues….and the new girl trying to steal all the scenes by making it about her when we want to see the main characters.
I loved this movie! Anyone else
Vfx are not that good
"Terrible movie… really I was expecting more from it. Not just a movie who is afraid to put real action, real horror, and a real script. 4/10"
"i watched it last saturday, and the following day i completely forgot i watched it. It`s so average and unremarkable that none of the scenes and action made me think even for a minute. 
Good thing i didn`t have to pay for it or I`d be pissed.
Blade Runner 2049 came out 7 years ago and i still remember some cool scenes and it makes me reflect on the subject. THAT`S a good movie."
"and to think that all this happened because of one dinosaur, the indominus Rex"
"This movie should definitely win an *Oscar* for ""Best Visual Effects"", they are top notch here!) 🔥"
If only Nick Robinson and Ty simpkins return
I actually found it entertaining and people disappointed with it went in thinking it would be something else . It's entertaining and that's all that matters in this type of movie !
These movies are the equivalent of a 2.5 hour long fast food commercial
"tbh, i watched the movie before this and i know that no one cares but still..."
"I think Jurassic world dominion will release in 2023.
 Can't believe why I didn't know that this movie was released 7 months ago."

"This movie is trash. What happen to “Jurassic Park”? This is like a FX TV show. The acting is bad, the story is stupid. It’s more of a spin off then movie. The writers got real lazy when writing this. The original Jurassic Park you can watch every time it’s on TV. These last two “Jurassic Parks” were ass cheeks."
What Day is Jurassic world Dominion coming on HBO max

how is it they survived in winter without adaptation???
"At the end in Washington D.C., there should have been a short clip of Donald Trump as President saying ""many people think there should have been better safeguards""."
The best and most iconic part from this movie was when the roll credit appeared
I just watched all Jurassic movies and I have to admit that this series shows the world how we live in. Thank God they made a whole story about how us humans wake up every morning wanting to be God.
"To be honest.. this movie was dissapointing asf...
Just compare this with jurrasic world indominus rex movie..
The tension that movie had and this one..."
"Nothing beats the first movie, everything else is   Sad. Story line sucks ass.."
"I seen this movie, it was f*ckin awesome. I love it"
”We’re gonna need a better conclusion”
Why can't i remember i already watched this movie😵‍💫😵‍💫
Jesus Christ loves you
The new Jurassic park sucks 😔 waste of money I miss the good ole days when the world wasn't so soft they won't even shoot a dinosaur because all these sensitive animal freaks get but hurt but a human can die 1000 different ways smh what is wrong with  you people! ...... Also the dinosaurs in the first movie look way more realistic then now who edited this ?
"Okay, the movie was meh. Maybe even bad. But we can all admit one thing:



The trailer freaking SLAPS"
"15 minutes in, and the *real creative writers* in Hollywood have come up with an Evil Corporation storyline. Man, these guys are good."
What was up with them using OLD YouTube footage of a subaru going off a cliff then adding a dinosaur in the shot.. or literally a clip from a short movie about dinosaurs as footage for their own film?
"Please, i will save you your time.
This is the most horrible JP movie ever made, and i dont see how it could get ANY worse when dinosaurs are involved.
It's simply ridiculous, painful, cringe, and the most over budget retard movie. If anything i hope this franchise goes extinct
DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let yourself s be warned."
The best movie loved it
WOOOOOOO
I'm watching this on peacock. So far the intro is not the best. CGi is bad.  Waist of money whoever agreed to pay for this junk..
I know it was good  my sister  went  to see it hahahah 😁❤❤❤❤
Super movie😄
BS movie. i lost my respect for spielberg. he's the only one who could make proper sequels for this franchise..
For you Darling https://youtu.be/cvqmgKOVPSw
"The dinosaurs had no point to the plot at all. The plot was ludicrous, locusts may be pests - but at worst, they are also a FOOD! (yes, people eat them!) They're also just as open to predation as any other insect, if not more so because the swarms would attract starving birds."
"overall a good movie but the Liberal BS was a bit old and highly predictable....more so absolutely boring to the point one has to skip many a dialogue of doom and gloom....but as i said, overall not a bad movie"
That's for changing it to buy

"I enjoyed this movie, don't really understand what's with the hate for this movie. I been watching Jurassic park since it ever came out first time and i enjoyed every single one."
What's funny is that Dr Malcom has been around for all 3 of these movies
is it intentional that the bad guy here looks like Tim Cook.... is that a nod to Apple 😜
What were they thinking? I was really disappointed in this one. Movie was boring. I didnt even watch the last 18 minutes of the film.
It would be cool if dinosaurs were actually real and existed at one time.
"Just watched the movie. It's horrible. Who the heck directed and coordinated the story?! Horrible job. Really hating how Americans are overusing one take cinematography. It's crazy dizzy and sloppy. Just zoom out enough to see the whole scene instead of following every single incident iditots! Or get a different angle! Just because it worked for a different movie, it doesnt mean its gonna work for dinosaur encounter action."
"Had high hopes for this since Spielberg was involved with the original cast and John Williams doing the soundtrack, hate to say but I left the theater feeling disappointed. Only good thing about the movie was John Williams songs."
All dinasour is died in asteroid
you were absolutly wonderful sara diescthy
sorry sara diechtsy
“What is that….Giganotosaurus..the biggest carnivore the world has ever seen”
"I’m literally crying right now,the Jurassic series was my life,I’ve watched all the movies through and through seeing it go really hit me hard😔."
go grant go
we can't keep running anymore
i want wifi dinosaur monsters
"This is and always will be my favorite movie of all time,the introduction of the old and new era of dinosaurs during the Jurassic era surprised me but I loved it, the Giganotosaurus,and the Therizinosaurus were by far my favorite Dinosaurs of all time besides rexy ofc,like lowkey the most of the plot surprised me but I can definitely give this movie a 10/10 they really killed it,this was literally one of the best finale movies “the world has ever seen”"
"WOWOW Laura Dern and Sam Neill are in this, this is nostalgia at its finest!"
Only thing I don’t like about this movie is how big they made raptors look
Garbage
lanjodaka
Hope you can see this comment. Not watching the movie. Same fascists censoring comments filling these movies with PC mandated trash. Why I won't watch that James Bond with the double 0 black chick. She's only there because she's a black chick.

Great references to bill gates trying to control the world's food supply. They hit the nail on the head with this one.

This movie was absolute garbage 🗑
One ugly movie. I watched it because they brought back the actors from the first jurassic park movie. Its nothing compared to it.

You know movie sux bad when you dont even download it via pirate
This was a masterpiece this was sick
bro wth I watched Jurassic world dominion and I didn’t even see this part 1:05
Isn't getting sick that the only reason the redhead is even in these movies is because of daddy. I don't know about you but I'm kinda sick of people's kids getting movies and shows because who there parents are. When there is real talent being looked over because of the parents of these people.
"David here from Sebring Florida USA 🇺🇸 I have been a movie buff for over fifty years and I think this is a great popcorn movie!
Nice to see everyone! I wish they could of put a photo on the original owner of jurassic Park in this movie did anyone happen to notice the three San Francisco Bay area references in the movie? The villain looks a lot like the CEO of Apple computers lol 😂 The movie at the Drive In was American graffiti and Mountain View California was mentioned in a documentary about dinosaurs please let me know if here if anyone else noticed thanks 😊"
Is blue good or bad?
I would watch it. But y'all must know that this shizzar is getting out of hand. Right?!
worst movie in Jurassic park history
"I'm sorry, this is the kind of movie that makes it really hard not to think about how much good 185 million dollars could have done in this world."
Steven Spielberg must be rolling in his grave.
"What if dinosaurs became so widespread and commonplace that the once awe-inspiring got reduced to a nuisance?  What if Jurassic Park movies became so widespread and commonplace that the once awe-inspiring got reduced to a nuisance?  Hey, don't get me wrong.  I love a big budget, cgi-packed non-movie as much as the next person, but that Chris Pratt character is hard to watch.  He was vacuous when he debuted, but now the cgi veloceraptor seems more substantive than him.  And why the heck is Ron Howard's daughter so kick-ass?  She's like an absurdly awesome action hero for no apparent reason, Pratt character too.  Ridiculous movie is difficult to complete watching."
I watched 10 min and its freaking Ridiculous it says we have to learn to live with them LMAO like if we don’t have fire power to stop them dinosaurs Maybe in third world country yeah they don’t have Technology they barley have food
Same story as the last movie quite bad lol
"You know this is NOT the end it is the middle of the beginning .....heh, heh, heh..."

"Im confused, I typed in “new James Bond movie” and this came up"
"Just watched it, not disappointing"
This movie sucked 👎 What did I watch? Indiana Jones?
I liked this thought it was awesome.  Then again I hated that horrible film moonlight and it won an Oscar.  Actually threw up in my mouth watching that git trash. But to each his own I guess
Fuck the critics. This flik kicks ass
Can they stop with the whole ✋thing. It's getting very cringey 🥴
Hey Steve Martin is in this?  It's gotta be good.  😂
Almost every scene in this movie was a copy from a scene or scenario in the first movie. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Fell asleep  twice 😴
Chris Pratt is such a terrible over dramatic actor. He just looks like he’s trying too hard and makes it cringe.
I guess JP3 isn't the worse movie out of all of them now seeing as this one exists
02:41
This brings tears to my eyes tbh because I grew up watching these and this was the last 1☹
":,)"
Stupidest part is when the blonde is fighting clarie trying to stab her with a knife an clarie hits her with the hot stick she's like you don't use it on people umm you don't use knives on people either but this is a street fight you ain't going by any set of rules either you just bad her weapon is better
"Back to the Future was a good Trilogy this one I have NEVER been so Frustrated watching a movie in all my LIFE!!!
What is it with yoU WRITER'S❗❓
YoU don't have human reactions down at ALL........!👈🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Two slow of a reactions every Single Time ( REALLY)"
"Dear God this movie was awful… I was ready to love it! I’ve loved all the films (but part 3) but this was…
What was this!? They thought bringing back everyone would just make the movie? WHAT WAS IT EVEN ABOUT? CLONES? WH…
😫 My God…
I…what was this? What was it? Who green lighted this?"
Hollywood movies are getting worse and worse.  Sure glad i didn't pay to see crap.   Oh none of the actors get eaten just a few extras.
This movie was great
This movie was straight trash.
Just watched this…what the hell did I just watch..
Man. This was totally worth subscribing to peacock tv. I finally know my spirit animal. The gentle giant with no agenda..   Brontosaurus💗🍵
This movie sucked
02:41
Bad movie without fantasy dont watch
"Really? He has clothes that wasn't made until millions of years later.  Good entertainment,  but it's false from the beginning."
Chris Pratt is greatest green screen actor of our time
These new sequels are total dog sh*t
It’s a same old story. Nothing new . Either it’s really boring or I am too old now 😂😂
Amazing scenes...
Amazing...
Star lord from the mcu
I feel like we will have to wait 15 or 10 years or year idk so we can see another jurassic film and i think it would be called jurassic orgins
One of the strangest movies of this year lmao.
So your watching the trailer after the movie realest
Bad movie
Can't wait to watch it not on Netflix where I can watch it
It has too much of resenblance with previous ones in terms of plot line. It is just a remix and rematch of all the things appeared in the franchise.
"😍😍Just watched the movie,, its epic,, I felt like I was in the movie. 5 star for this one.  Excellent"
"so finally watched it.. I confirm it's R.E.T.A.R.D.E.D!!!!!
same shitty storyline! the heroes save everyone! 
everyone is trustworthy and helpful and selfless! blablabab!
no one dies except for the villain 
Humans are a piece of shit.. they would never risk their lives like this for others and for no reason!
And everyone is sweet to each other no personality clashes! all are good guys! haha"
how humans failed to learn from previous jurassic experiments
I don't understand why you have ruin this part of movie totally disappointing.The movie is totally opposite then the trailer.
Very very bore filmmmm..... 🙏🙏🙏
"Just watched it a couple nights ago. I thought it was perfect, just wish they could have gotten Julianne Moore in it as well.  And nice to finally see the result of Dr Grant and Ellie Sattler finally together!"
"basically the fast and the furious but with dinosaurs haha 

i miss all the sci fi and philosophical elements"
"1:57 hang on, owen did you manage to go to a strange dark pizzeria with quirky animatronics?"
It would have been better if the Spinosaurus was in here humiliating the Giganotosaurus for being the largest carnivore
I want to like to watch Jurassic World Dominion and in peacock you can watch Jurassic World Dominion and it comes up right on Friday September 2nd 2022
"I'm gonna love this , the exiting part was blue got a kid !! 🤧🥰"
T.Rex vs Giganotosaurus vs Therizinosaurus-https://youtu.be/mKEa8-YoWns
Finally got around to watching this as I had low expectations and well yeah … it was awful 😅
"I just came to say. That was the worst Jurassic Park movie of them all. How did you do that, I don’t know. I got a sense of relief when i saw the credits."
I'm in the first 20 min of this movie and I'm mad I rented this from Redbox. I would have been seriously mad if I went to the theaters to see this. The storyline so far is wack. The introduction is meh.
This was horribly awful
cool
When I saw this movie in the cinema I thought it was a very solid sequel but could of been made a lot better
Bit disappointing storyline is bery slow
at least this trailer is LONGER!
I’m watching the movie today im excited 😊
Action: 7.5/10. CGI/VFX: 8/10. Story: 5.5/10. It's kind of movie for those who just want to see something cool on the big screen and don't really care about storylines
B rated movie for B rated society.
Thursday 25th August 2022. I saw Jurassic Dominion in the Cinema with my friend Isobel Mason and we both loved it! 💜 Virginia Clark.?! ;) ;( :) 😊🐷🐶🦊🐺🦕🦖.
I watched the movie it was amazing!
"they need to stop this franchise just like Fast & Furious , it's becoming ridiculous"
"Very stupid story,like USarmy doesn't exist no more,fighting dinosaures would have been more lucrative to ind.military complex than Ukrainian war."
I think I’m now done with this franchise
"After just watching the movie, I would say that some stories are best left extinct."
It's has Tim Cock in this movie.
Ian Malcom: bigger why do always go bigger Gigantosaurus: *gasps* its Sam Neil Laura dern and Jeff goldblum can I have your autograph.
"Well now we have 3 good films (JP, JP2, JW) and 3 terrible ones (JP3, JW2, JW3) can we stop now please."
I finally watched this movie on DVD.  I had to forward it too many times because it seems like it was written by a 10 year old with no understanding of biology/ecology. And the ridiculous clichés were just overwhelming to the point I wanted to puke.  It is the worst movie I have seen all year.
😊
I liked jurassic Park when i was a kid and i still liké it
They turned the franchise into a God damn Pokémon movie!
This JP was mediocre & the extended cut version was a lot better. This movie is still better than part 3 & Fallen Kingdom
Not a good movie that I was expected
Hi
Blue have a seperate fan base ♥️
Worst movie I ever watched
I myself my name being Dominic & my girlfriend Jeana & I both enjoyed this film just as we have all of them. I love the giant Locusts a lot! They are very cool. We both feel a film is always going to be crapped on no matter what very sadly so.
I myself don't understand why this film has been getting so much hate. My girlfriend and i just watched it for the first time last night on dvd and we both enjoyed the film. Yes it was very nice to see the old cast & the new together. Is it a perfect film o'kay may be not but it is a good film. We are both going to give it a second viewing. I myself with that they had made and come out with a figure to scale with the film of one of the locusts. Giant Grass Hoppers Locusts what have you. I myself thought that they were very creepy and very cool.
Can’t wait for it to start as long as it ain’t on Peacock Premium.
"Poor Peter, he has save the space, save dinosaurs and save princess from another castle. someone, Give him rest."
"I watch it and i get disappointed, Can the dino get tired during the chase scenes and the company does it want and the government and army just let it slide, are they made of steel the dinosaur."
"I can guess why this movie is not liked by critics.  Chris Pratt is in it.  That is a terrible reason, and the reason why I will NEVER watch a movie based on critics, they lie now anyway to save face and stay part of the in crowd."
Great wonderful movie! But in reality there's was some American soldiers during the time of Civil War. They saw a pterodactyl dinosaur flying above them. They opened fire at the bird it was wounded if flew off a couple miles. The soldiers followed the pterodactyl until fell hit the ground and died! The idiot American soldiers put the last living dinosaur on display in front of a barn door. The native Americans tribes called the pterodactyl the great thunder bird. That was last extinct flying pterodactyl dinosaur. 🦕
This trailer makes you think it’s one movie and it’s completely different
"What can be said about this movie? Not close to how fun and great the first JW was, but far superior to Fallen Kingdom, it ended with me feeling empty. Story was shallow and utterly ridiculous most of the time (for a dinosaur movie), however seeing Dr Grant and Dr Sadler brought back the nostalgia of the first film. This was the highpoint of the movie......Where I'd say first JW was a solid 3 star movie and Fallen Kingdom was 1 1/2 stars, this is a 2 - 21/2 star movie all day long. 
Liked the change in environments
...Didnt like that Rexy wasn't in the final moments. . She should had been."
These movies would be a lot better if they gave us more dinosaurs and less bad acting.   With the exception of Jeff Goldblum.  You can never put too much Goldblum in a movie.
well I watched Jurassic world camp Cretaceous it's a episode movie where a bunch of campers try to escape Jurassic world because of a evacuation
"I don't think dinosaurs behaved that way,except the Triceratops, it would have probably toppled  your car during breeding season."
"Do not torrent download this movie, apparently Universal isn't doing very good and...Needs money. My Isp turned off my internet for that. Idk who downloaded your shitty ass movie, it wasn't me. I was hacked. Your movie sucked ass though."
I heard this movie isn’t that good so come it has so many likes??
Wow - the trailer alone got over 59 million views.
"Wtf, woke Hollywood turned a dinosaur movie into a fast and furious finding a little girl plot with a unnatural monster dinosaur with terrible action"
i loved this
I am truly amazed !!! . Could you all imagine seeing this @ a mega Imax theater not just your regular theater screen ??? OMG or what y'all !!! Lol
When it comes out
i like the movie lkit Claw
"I’m not wasting 2 hours of my life,.. I’ll PASS"
"Lack dominion? Lol dinosaurs start existing they getting hunted for their meat and skin/leather. They would be like tigers or wolves.. pushed to the brink of extinction, just to become a controllable species. That humans can manipulate to their liking. (Especially the TRex)"

Sam Neil is a Kiwi... his American accent just sounds wrong

Jurasic park becoming too fast and furious. Stupid nonsense. A trex can chase a plane.? What a stupid movie
BEST MOVIE EVER I DEFINITELY CANT WAIT TILL THEY MAKE ANOTHER PART OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
Is it just me or this was the worst jurassic movie ever?
Pure schlock.
I was waiting for this from so long timeee

I have the Most Giganotosaurus Crush on Claire Dearing. She’s Rexy Gorgeous 💖
Oh, and Maisie Lockwood is growing Bluetifully 🥰
So there Beta be a Part 4…."
"Looks like they ""crystal skulled"" Jurassic Park...."
"Film Grain, should have been cleaned up in editing. Really distracting with no real benefits in my opinion. The transition aerial shots look very clean and cuts look totally off when cut between the two.

Should have shot on Digital Camera like RED 8K"
Rexy should’ve had a baby
fucked up movie that is it
Badest Jurassic Movie EVER!

Come to find out it's still playing in theatres and it was released back in June,lol,with."
Yai hai t-rex
This movie is a piece of Sh!t.
Already $975 million worldwide at the box-office for this 3rd JW. Could 🦖🦕 reach the billion $ before September ? 👀
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Every movie is seems similar to me agree or not first they open a park and collapsed and escaping and evil dinosaur is getting killed and happy ending until next park opens🥴🤭
"I honestly liked this movie....the story isnt a good deal in it but the action scenes are so great to watch, Also the amount of reference they give from old movies was amzaing..critics and fans must have mixed reaction but i dont care if i enojyed a movie than didnt matter the fact how hate it got i liked it"

Horrible bullshit movie... total waste of time
"is this the last movie of jurassic world , cause i am a fan of jurassic movie's"
https://youtu.be/fb5ELWi-ekk
You’ll be cheering for the dinos to pick off the actors.
This movie is academy award material. Jeff Goldblum’s acting is everything we’ve come to expect.
"Shit movie
At begging he can hold a dinosaur with a rope, they can run away easy from raptors, the woman electrocuted with a teaser when the raptor jumps on her, she runs from raptor easy and we can see how fast they are, black woman save the day,and black man couldn’t be killed by raptors but the whites yes, and he arrest the white buissnes woman. Etc etc, is like a 7 years old child play. Airplane crash survive with no injured, have you all see an airplane crashing with face ?they escape so easy from dinosaur attack, even from gigantosaur, I’m sure mike Tyson would kick their asses"
i seen this incredible movie 3 times
Say what you want to say about this movie. I will defend it with my life.
boring.. remakes after remakes after remakes.. doesn't hollywood have anymore ideas?
40min in and I already feel like it's garbage. What happened to movies. Since 2019 they all feel crcsly like garbage. U hardly find a movie that stays in ur soul and keep remembering it. 🚮
I don't like it. Dinosaurus seem so fake with computer! I prefer when they used robots in the first Jurassic Park
"wrg, big x s 1uferiox bloat, doesn matater"
Garbage
After seeing the Quetz and the Therizinosaurus I am convinced that the writer's of this movie have been playing Ark.
I enjoyed this movie and the Movie Theatre yesterday.
I missed jurassic Era from 1993 to 2022 from universal pictures and ambling entertainment
"It's cool to see the original stars, except Goldblum, his character was such an annoying ass. Wish he'd gotten eaten in the first movie. I'm surprised they even made a 3rd movie after the 2nd one which totally sucked. The second movie was a total rip off of Jurassic Park 2, my least favorite. Boring same shit, different day. This plot line seems so unrealistic. How'd all those dinosaurs get all over the place? How did they reproduce? I'll wait till it comes to Netflix and watch it when I can't find anything else to watch."
I like my guys how I like the new JP films ; ruined
"It's good to know that I'm not the only one who loved this movie. I really enjoyed it 
It's a great movie"
"1:57 we speak about the ""I Always Come back"" of Owen Grady who sounds very similar of William afton's one ? 😂"
Bad movie and boring. Why all new movies are bad wtf
Life actually found a way
This movie was a insult for everyone’s childhood
"I had no idea, that Tim Cook was in this movie."
"Very empowering, stunning and brave."
"Absolutely speechless, the entire Jurassic series simply drags one to the Jurassic era where one could encounter the terrifying monsters. And lastly bit dissapointed as the leading starcast are now older by some 20+ years."
"I know a lot of people are disappointed
I will fix this
Give me time."
"Nah, tbh this movie was over-hyped, I mean WAY to over-hyped, and estimated.."
"Weak, disappointing movie. Two thumbs down."
"Fantastic finish to a fantastic series, my mom and I saw it in AMC theatres and we loved it and saw all the previous movies. She reminded me of all the tie ins because I hadn't seen the originals since I was a kid! It was nostalgic seeing the original cast. The storyline was satisfying and definitive. Jeff Goldblum's line was very profound and timely: ""We don't only not have Dominion over nature, we're subservient to it!"". I was happy I got to see it. I also appreciated how it was a continuation of Jurassic World."
"Wow. I’m a Jurassic Park fan, but this movie suuuuucked. Bad acting, everything was a cliche, story was ALL over the place, and it was boooooring. A couple next to us in the theater got up and left after 30 mins…we should have done the same and saved some brain cells 😩"
Fucking boring from start to finish.
"Just like everything else these days Jurassic Park has been ruined by woke trash.  It is a spy movie? A thriller? An environmental documentary? Social commentary?  It lacks substance.  It shuffles from scene to scene like a tired old zombie.  The movie was helped by the original cast.  I find it hard to believe Jeff Goldblum signed off on that terrible speech.   There is essentially nothing here that made Jurassic Park a great movie series.  It’s trying to be too much because they spend the entire time trying to convince you woke is they way you should live your life and how reality is.  Fortunately it’s not and woke is trash. Many of the characters are weird looking. The dinosaurs are second fiddle to pushing climate change and other woke trash ideology.  Woke has ruined Jurassic Park just like Star Wars and everything else.
I paid 30.00 bc my wife loves these movies and we barely made it an hour and asked and then received a refund from Amazon.  You can’t tell a story when your philosophy and “science” isn’t real and has done more to harm humanity then help it.  It’s nothing but woke trash to program you with a political agenda and take your money.  Very very terrible. The plot has nothing to do with dinosaurs other than they were in the background."
This is just a joke but Owen said he always comes back is he William afton?

Therizinosaurus 1:28-1:36 giginotosaurus 2:27-2:40 pyroraptor 1:48-1:53
Saw the original JP but never watched any of the series of subsequent installments. Reading these comments confirms not to waste my time with this. Thank you all. Back to work.
Looks good! People will find anything to complain about. I Haven’t seen it yet but now I’m considering. Had to watch the trailer first to make sure. I think I saw the first Jurassic Park but not the others. Looking forward to it.
"Well here we go again,initially the first movie was really good,it gave us a sense of awe which was awesome,the second was crap to pick a dinosaur up and fix it leg well what can I say,the third not much better but perhaps a bit more likeable,the latest Jurassic world with Chris Pratt fast paced movies although entertaining are still not great,I've only seen a clip of this latest release but him putting his hand up and making a dinosaur a promise (what can I say)I tried this with my dog the other day,she didn't look impressed but the moment I said walkies we connected,I had a great time walking my dog & it was certainly cheaper"
"👎 The difference of this film with the original one (Jurassic Park), is that this movie is made just for your money. They just don't care about the cinematography. They just don't care to create a good film for you. They just put some stupid effects in the scenes and go into theaters, to earn some money. Movies are made for storytelling, not just graphics. Movies should be art, not business ideas. This movie is a complete failure. 👎"
Super wrost movie
This was first Jurassic movie where budget cuts and bad script/producing was super obvious - why would the edward scissorhands dino swipe and kill the deer and worse the deer just stand there eating not real life at all - in real life a crack of twig would send deer jumping - yet scissorhands just slowly follows the redhead like he on Sunday afternoon stroll - the positioning of dino heads virtually vs real life cast is sometimes off - towards end where dinos fighting with cast in the middle.
Not bad but full of all the woke messages of today's movies
20$ dollars 💵 to rent it on Amazon lol 😅😂🤣🖕🖕🏾🖕🏽🖕🏿

For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist."

So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”"
"The only thing i liked a about this movie is the reunion of Alan, Elie and Ian and when John Williams' original score hits. That was the only goosebump I got. Rest of the movie was cheesy to say the least,  esp the action sequences. I wasted my money on prime video. Now time for the original and reliving my childhood."
Good 👍👌
Good film Well done on the effects and cgi
"Gotta be honest, they always say it’s the finale conclusion"
Fhul move dalo hindi me sir
This is a great movie with Jeff Goldblum entertaining as ever!  I highly recommend this movie for all familys and all ages.  Its kid friendly but also extremely entertaining for adults too.  I took my GF to see it she thought it was going to be terrible but she loved it.  Dinos and explosions you cant go wrong with that.  The plot was entertaining too.  I mean the whole Jurassic series is already an absurd fictional fantasy so long as you dont get too serious with this movie you will like it a lot.  I mean get real!  Its dinosaurs reeking havoc as always!  Its basically like a really well done classic B monster movie.
Owen’s relationship with blue is like a Snow White story
Honestly I have no idea why people hated the movie I loved it.
Watched this last night gotta say its not as good as the 1993 one it was that awful i fell asleep through it a couple of times
Nice movie❤❤
omg this is the last movie of the franchise🥺
"Laura Dern still looks beautiful at 54, Sam Neill is 74, still looking well for his age, Jeff Goldblum the same, time has been kind to them."
most boring movie in all jurrasic parts
"Disaster......boring script...totally ilogic....dumb dinozaurs...usless lines between actors...locust?! really?! How much % on the whole movie shows the dinozaurs action? Save some money on the CGI?! They ruin the movie......ohhhh...and the last fight dino gang brawl. No more JP, JW please."
"They made the trailer look good, them was the only good parts in the whole dam movie so mad I wasted my time and money"
Traaassshhhhhhh
#NOTE do not waste your money on this boring a** movie they talked for hour and half the whole dam movie
This movie hurts more then my dads beatings
"What a load of crap, how the fuck did the dinos spread to all continents and breed like that. i know it's a movie but talk about plot holes."
"The earth is a flat circle with a firmament, Nikola Tesla knew it. The first man to the stratosphere said it seemed a flat disk with an upturned edge. The state of Georgia just said it was flat. All NASA images are CGI, 100 percent fact. The word firmament is used in the holy Bible 240 times. The word firmament in its Hebrew definition is the vast solid dome God created on the second day to separate the waters above and the waters below. Werner Von Braun on his death bed said it was all a lie. And left one Bible verse on his grave stone. Psalms 19:1. Why does one think it's illegal to go to Antarctica or just to far south in general? They don't want you to see the ice wall, that circles the earth. The Vikings knew it. The moon does not reflect light from the sun. When measured the item in the moon's light is always cooler than the item in the moon's shade. The sun and moon are also local. This is very easy to see looking at the rays. The stars are not as far as they claim either and look really neat when zoomed in on by the globe buster p1000 camera. The ying yang represents the sun and the moon, that's how they move around in a circle. The sun only looks like it is setting due to depth perception. If you look down a straight row of street lights they will start to go under the ""horizon"" just like the sun seems to set. But it doesn't. It's just moving away. We are not on a ball that is physically impossible. Water would not find level. And no gravity isn't a fact, it's not even a good theory stated by Google. All I've said is the truth, VANYA"
This saga made my childhood awesome ✌️
"Ohh i see, now is make sense why starlord punch thanos"
Definitely better than Jurassic world fallen Kingdom
"One thing : the Jurassic Sanctuary looks exactly like the Apple RING HQ and true to the eyes is the man Dr. Lewis Dodgson is exactly like Tim Cook .
What the hell is going on in this version of JW !"
Worst movie I've ever seen. So glad the trilogy is finally over. Maybe the next ones will be in the hands of competent people next time.
I had never watched any of Jurassic park series but my bf literally forced me to watch the first one before going to the theatre for the latest one and now I really appreciate him :)) You can see a lot coming from that! I’d personally say that previous stories were slightly better but it’s just so stunning to see all of my favorite characters at the same time!!!!!
dont get all the negative feedback on the movie. i thought it was hilarious! i quite enjoyed the parts where the raptors and t-rex's were eating people. snack time! its a human buffet! deeeelicious!
horrible had to stop watching
"4 out of ten at best , seriously disappointed !!"
ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

"Having eventually watched this movie, it's time for the franchise to die, IMO. The story has no more juice. Actors seem completely cleansed of their previous stamina. The story tries to sell too many stories to too vast an audience (youngsters Vs elders, men Vs women, etc.). The plot is so full of holes and ""God's Will"" moments that we're left to sigh and wish for the movie to last not as long. And this added, Woke-compatible sugar-coating is just too much for me to bear. It seems very clear that the marketers that were put in charge of making this movie (yes, IMO, the director's creativity was totally submitted to the marketing guys' directives!!) had a ""to do list"" to go through: gay character: check (""I like read-haired too""); relatable dinosaurs: check; women's machismo: check; white middle-aged villain (plus, all the dinosaurs' victims are white! Isn't ThAT a form of reverse racism???): check; unharmed children: check... and the list goes on! Instead of focusing on this politically correct aspect of the movie by throwing so many short-lived fishing lines, the director should have focused on what we, the audience, are looking for first and foremost: dinosaurs living in our world. What would be the implication of that? Well, the movie as it has been made offers pretty much no clear answer. In failing here, it signs the end of the franchise for good."
Feels off. The dinosaurs didn't feel as scary as the older movies. not a lot of chaos
Stunning 😍🔥
"Yeah,old school actors,i will watch it for this reason."
In this case life found a way to f up a franchise

"All those dinosaurs and the threat was from giant locust, bit silly but I did enjoy the film"
Isla Sorna
This movie lacks personality and direction. Its like the characters are just given names and roles to you. They do not build up to any of that and not to mention couple of bad actresses
This video's comment section sorted by Newest doesn't make seem like 77% of the audience liked the flim according to Rotten Tomatoes 🤣
"can't believe the trailer gets us hyped for Human and dinosaurs coexisting issues, for them to throw in a different plotline

this movie made Rise of Skywalker look good."
Very bad film. Had to turn it off. Wow
"The other scene was when blue was like "" May the raptor be with you."" cried for days. And another was when grant was like "" now that's a dominion"" and just domminined all over the place. But of course it was after that absolute scene where rexy was like "" it's jurassin' time""  in unison with Chris pratt. Made my life I will never need more than the giant tickle chicken."
People ar crazy they already have done for real this animals

"Just watched the movie, who ever wrote the scenario, please find your self another job. You have ruined the entire jurassic movie. Garbage of 2.25 hours and even this trailer is better than the movie. The IMDB rating is 5 and getting worst, even hindi movies have better score lol."
"Ah yes, genetically engineered bio weapons to ""accidentally"" reduce the world's population. So glad it's just a movie...I want my 20 bucks back!!"
"The best part was when the t rex got up and said "" I am jurassic world"" then Chris pratt nodded at her and they both said "" it's jurassin' time"" then jurrassed all over those other peasent dinosaurs, whole theater clapped for two days, was better than my wedding and birth of my son combined, it was an absolute scene."

What's the release date
"A movie for a long time without benefit, don't like it"
The beaded curtains in the plane was the overkill for me....
Man this movie really sucks. I wish it was rated R and was more horror
""" I always come back "" now isn't that horrifically fimiliar"
"Well, the dinosaurs were so real! And, some bad people tried to dominate the world, because they thought locusts could make humanity go extinct. And also, everybody was reunited and that was great. Because I just love Jurassic World and Park! The End."
This is trash. This whole concept of learning to live with the dinosaurs is super corny. The cgi is terrible and the story is garbage.
I saw the movie last night. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a good send off for the franchise.
Trash film.
This movie was so bad
Ross Geller would be super thrilled!
well now I feel as though I've watched the movie and it seems bad
I hate how this movie was more about humans than it is about dinosaurs. And the ending sucks
This one movie really got me mixed with deep emotions and I cheered them on... Great movie going to watch it again... Cool they got the origin cast and replayed scenes from the first movie... Blue is a momma Awwww
dinosaurs are coming to life so get ready to  save the world is going to end really please reel
So cool 🦖🦕🦖🦕
"Jurassic World.
Orca and Dunkleosteus are of the same lineage, so they may have territorial battles and have dorsal fins.

omq giga here  😯😯
What a pile of crap...They have quite literally 'cut and pasted' all of the scenes from all the previous movies and changed the faces of the actors.
Sorry but I didnt like it . IM A JURASSIC FAN JUST I DIDNT LIKE THE STORY OF THIS ONR
"Just watched - great movie but why oh why, when you have one of the greatest soundtracks in the history of film, do you completely ditch it (other than 1 or 2 brief moments) especially when bringing back the original cast. Strange decision for me."
"I knew this was going to be dumb, but I rented It anyway and I wasn't wrong. This is dumber than the last 5 combined. The only hope of getting any satisfaction out of this ""big pile of sh!t"" is if it loses lots of money. And if people see this, word will spread like a virgins legs on prom night....if there is such a thing as a virgin on prom night anymore."
Nothing about dinosaurs and humans living so peaceful or learn us and not eat us us not true. I am nit a scientist but jurassic park has gotten more and more unrealistic. Its nature im soooo disappointed in the juradsic park movies. HUG FAN IF DINOSAURS juss sayinnn
"This trailer gave me chills, and I wasn’t even alive when the first one came out!!!"
lame
"I was honestly so dissaponted when I walked out of this movie. Don't get me wrong,I loved the returning cast mixed with the new and the action sequences are always fun to watch.  However,the film was completely dumbed down by its predictability and generic conveniences and it ends up making the film fall apart for making absolutely no sense. The worst part about this film is that it felt very rushed. And once I got to a certain part in the film,I was like ""that's it?"". The film is 2hr and 26 mins and it somehow felt shorter than it was supposed to. But anyways, It's still a fun dinosaur movie but it has way to many issues to the point where it's just OK. I still think Jurassic Park and Jurassic World are still the best."
It couldn't get even more cheese. Will not be seeing this one.
"Woow amazing how the whole thing became spoiled with the first two jurassic world movies, and bc that didn't seem bad enough theres a third one , and even brings back the old folks for this gathering of stupidity.  Very poor story! I love Jurassic Park...but this... what the..."
Damn this was the best movie probably in the world especially with all of the Og’s in the last one
To be honest I paid $13 to see this movie and if I would’ve known ahead of time I was gonna be asleep half the time I would’ve stayed my butt at home 😭🙄
No shut it this is confounded final .
Terrible..
Easily the least impressive movie from the franchise like if you agree
"The plot was just terrible. Don't get me wrong, I loved the 1 & 2 movie but this one was just not good."
woow its amazing!
"WHERE I CAN READ A NON OFFICIAL TRUTHFUL REVIEW THAT IS NOT FAKED AND ADULTERATED LIKE THIS ONE? If you come here for a review, go somewhere else. You will only find patronizing comments in here, even if the movie is a pile of trash. Its an advise."
"The fact that most people here seem to ""love"" this ""movie"" says it all. I miss so much the older days when GOOD movies and GOOD tv shows were made. And not the pile of trash and garbage we got these past ten years."
"One of the worst movies ive ever seen in a long long time. And of course the worst dinoarus movie ive seen in well, ever. I mean, i cant believe people watch these movies to see DINOSAURS, and then they only thing they see are animatronics of 2022, with terrible special effects, dinosaurs running like if they were in skates, completely idiotic scenes (like the first one), but what amazes me the most are the special effects. How is that the original movie from 1993? has better special effects than this?????? unbelievable. 

That first scene, how it is possible that an edmontosaurus that is ten times bigger than a human dont have enough strenght to pull up that trunk and the guy himself and keep running without any problems at all???? i mean, this is what people love to see???? idiotic scenes designed for 4 year old kids? 

And thats how they catch them??? with horses and cowboy sh1t??????? i even thought this was a joke somehow...


And i didnt even get to finish watching it, i couldnt. After 55 minutes it was enough for me. I have other better ways to waste my time, really."
I didn't realise Tim Cook was in this..  :)))
Is it out yet?
"save your time, watch first instead"
worst jurassic park movie so bad
Go woke go broke
"CGI hasn't improved in over 10 years. These dinosaurs should look real by now but they dont, hollywood needs to update their software."
"Love all the dinosaur Jurassic Park movies. This Dominion one needs a better sound guy. I set the volume at a good level to hear all the talking than an exciting chase scene comes on  and who ever did the sound for this Cranks the music to 100% then we have to set it at a level as not to disturb the neighbors. The the scene ends and have to turn it up again because ya CAN'T  HEAR THE TALKING !! No reason to Boost the music so loud it rumbles the floor, not the dino's but the music. ridiculous...  
But it was a very good move, just keep the sound at a lever as not to adjust the volume every 10mins.."
the mighty morphin power rangers has real dinosaur powers now
Thing is the extremely large dinosaurs could not live in our atmosphere now. The oxygen level is to low compared to when they existed  they would die of lack of oxygen.
Why am I just finding out about this omg!!!!!
So many people loved this movie while I’m sitting here thinking « did we watch the same movie? ». 😭🤣.
Movie is ass. But damn does that trailer gives chills
"I still feel as if the villian should have been the spino, as he would practically get revenge and Dr. Alan, (revenge from JP lll ) Plus they did not  even kill him off in the Camp Cretaceous series. Also, for the people who think the spino is a girl, the creators of JP lll Did in-fact state that the spino is a male."
I watched this and the ending is great
"After watching it my with kids last night, honestly it was ok, but some scenes were meh, my 9 year old liked it because he is such a huge fan of these movies, but he made jokes throughtout it because i guess it kind of bored him? the 6 year old fell asleep lol"
0/10 wast of time
"Well, could have been better, i love Jurassic world (2015) more, if it happens that they make another,  maybe put claire in charge of another park or facility again under Masrani foundation, using the Masrani foundation money to ""clean up the mess"", with very rich and greedy Mrs Masrani in charge and being hard headed and exploiting the animals, with little knowledge about them and just weaponising some to obtain power and control. And maybe having some research projects funded and interns ground to learn more and bring new ideas with Zac maybe interning at the new park and his brother coming to visit him before all hell breaks loose, point is, 2015 time line just needed an extension. But then again, i'm just a writer. Great franchise though."
I like how the trailers emphasize the dinosaurs in cities and stuff were in movie it emphasize more about the locust which was in one scene in the trailer
Pure garbage.
Blue got a
Snyder cut music
These are turning into the next fast and furious movies. Absolute trash.
world movie ever lmoa literally no dinosaurs
It looks exciting🤔👍🥳
Dumbest film i ever did saw!
Kinda good movie
"i feel like the movie shouldn’t have the locusts and farming plot in it. maybe if they only focused on finding beta and encountering dinos around the world, it would be a good movie. but the action scenes were hella good"
Simply awful watched it today. If one removes the dinos from this movie it won't affect much. Dinosaurs were extras in this movie
By the way what is the name of the movie
Can someone who has seen it tell me if it would be scary for my little boy?  (6 years-old). He LOVES dinosaurs and is a big fan of Jurassic World...but thinks Jurassic Park (the 1st one) is scary.
I think it would be interesting if they came out with a prequel to jurassic park. The movie would take place on isla sorna and would explain why isla sorna was abandoned. The scientists make dinosaurs for jurassic park. A few dinosaurs escape and everyone that's on the island need to find a way off. There could also be some rival company that's trying to steal the dino DNA to use for there own dinosaur theme park.
Why did the spinosaurus not appear 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This movie is so bad….
1:56 William Afton moment XD
How did this look good to anyone?
THE BEST ARE  >>>> Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
"You get chased by 100 dinosaurs and don't get a scratch smh, I don't like how they did they best not to harm to the dinosaurs but allow the dinosaurs to eat so many people, and I will to extra with stunts that would never work in the real world"
Probably the worse Jurassic park  movie  !!
"Just watched the movie yesterday and I loved it. Loved all scenes with Blue obviously but these ones were unreal. Especially when Beta was taken. There was some cheesiness and some clunky dialogue but overall it was great.
Although it did do something I've found common in a lot of movies lately. 
Sometimes scenes do not need a score behind them. A conversation free of music trying to evoke emotion is sometimes more effective. Like Alan & Ellie's first conversation in Alan's tent.
I noticed this in Thor: Love and Thunder too. Though that movie was just bad.

I hope we get more. I have always loved these movies. It's escapism and entertainment... and dinosaurs! (Thank God there were no hybrids)."
l saw movie again 4 times did not saw the first trailer and l love it it best movie l ever see of my life.
"https://youtu.be/ZS2XmMScFvE

Movie is straight cheeks! Complete waste of time!
Can't Wait!
JURASSIC WORST - WORLD DISASTER OF A MOVIE. Fixed the title for everyone
This movie sucked.
uau
Spiderman no way home but the jurassic version
terrible movie
worst ever! overusing the hand sign when it get popular in previous one.
More than couple scenes that don’t make sense and are not related to the plot/ message of the movie. I felt like something is missing. They could have done it better than this.
"if this is the best they could do, happy to see the extinction of the Jurassic movies."
"La peor pelicula de la saga esta mediocremente escrita, dirijida y los efectos especiales son asquerosos, me desepcionaron pudo ser algo tan bueno."
i coincidentally made a prediction about dinos going worldwide when this movie came out…AND HOW WAS MY PREDICTION TRUE???

ITS GRATE JURASSIC WORLD FOREVER!!!!! ❤❤❤ I LOVE IT!! ❤❤
How is the Jurassic franchise already almost 30 years old like how is the era ending at like only 30 years I thought would end later
Jannat 3345
N.......I........C.........E       movie
Did they learn nothing from the fast and furious franchise? They are more interested in theatrics than the original story line.
"I've seen it. They should have released it June 11, 2023. Exactly 30 years later from the movie Jurassic Park. This would have allowed for them to tighten things up. I felt that there wasn't enough Therizinosaurus scenes as well as Tyrannosaurus Rex scenes. Jurassic Park had the Tyrannosaurus Rex for about 3/4ths of the movie terrorizing the park guests. It was nice to see Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Bradley Daryl Wong, though."
0:27 this is scary sound
Is it just me or was the newer cast scenes better in this movie than the old cast scenes?
The final movie was okay but it annoys me that they found a way to train the dinosaurs (just by sticking your hand up - who knew?) The point of the book (and original film) is that you can't control nature. In this film you literally have a raptor returning to say goodbye to the humans! Talk about destroying the tension... And the whole point.
Worst movie ever if they ever invent oscars for the worst movie ever this movie takes the lead. No plot everyone was out of place I dont know what the director was thinking I wonder did he even bothered in looking at the movie first and think I'm going to ruined a dinosaur movie that everyone looks up to. What a way in ruining the last movie.
"It was almost pasable (never good, just pasable) but there were some dinosaurs in my locusts movie."
lol oh no 50 dinosaurs got out of containment and there was literally nothing we could have done and now they're just a part of nature.... even dumber that previous JP premises. World governments would have hunted down those dinos within a week and killed all of them
"Movie ain’t a good Jurassic park movie, but I actually kinda liked it."
Best Movie Ever In My Opinion No Cap
WHAT WERE WITH THE LOCUSTS IN THIS MOVIE DUMB PLOT LINE
Stupid movie
I think this is the worst Jurassic Park movie ever made. Even Jurassic made in 90s better than this one. Terribly made.
(sigh) It’s another unnecessary sequel. Some people just can’t let go of past glory.
"The film was overall very good. It took a bit to get going, but very worthwhile if you stay for the whole thing.  Thanks for making this film.  Quite enjoyable"
Pretty stupid they went the woke route and made the farming industry the bad guy and made the new monster fucking locusts... libtards fucked up jurassic park now
This movie was the worst thing to happen to dinosaurs since the extinction event 65 million years ago.
The camera angles changed 12 times a second. Was extremely poorly made.  I think a group of 10 year olds could have produced a better movie with one tenth of a budget. It was horrendous on every level
I would rather go to prison than have to watch this film again. Its god damn awful!!!
This movie is American garbage at its finest. I have nothing good to say after watching this. I can't even think of a movie that is more poorly made. its a disaster.
"I'm not even exaggerating, but this was the worst film I have ever watched in my life. The camera angle changed every 0.3 seconds and it was impossible to get a feel for any scene/setting. And the acting was atrocious from every single actor. Even Chris Pratts role was awful. I wouldn't even rate this 1 out of 100. its a zero"
"The worst film i've seen since ""After Earth"" with Will Smith's son. 
No story line. Acting beyond terrible. And the screen play was just close ups of people's faces. No deaths on camera. 
Jurassic park 1 & 2 were exceptional for the era. This will be one of the most forgotten high budget films of all time."
"This movie sucks, it’s so unoriginal. It’s like James Bond but with dinosaurs or fast and furious if you replaced the cars with dinosaurs. Who ever thought this is how the franchise should go is an idiot. The last two movies weren’t all that good but this is just stupid. Chris Pratt and the stupid hand thing, what a joke."
"Lazy acting, lazy dinosaur fights and most importantly a lazy story. I love the Jurassic movies since childhood, I was hoping not to be disappointed, but I’m wrong."
predictabel lame and cringyy!!
Arriving in a helicopter over a fantastic landscape cliché
👆👆 Alright Congratulations you have been shortlisted among my lucky winners👆👆
the old one was much much better
"I predicted that it would be worst that Fallen Kingdom. Yes. Worst than that, believe it or not. I was right of course. Now for those who loved the trailer how to you feel now that you watched this piece of long shit?"
"I feel the acting in this was absolute shit, the story was crap and the characters where bland. Not sure how or what changed from the first in this trilogy, the 2nd was ok and this one was shocking"
Jurassic park 1993 and this movie is my favorite all time
I watch all jurassic park movies but this movie is very beautiful this movies story is amazing.  Thanks a lot of team to making this movie love u
This movie was such a disappointment
Is it scary
"As a dinosaur lover from a child (like most of us) starting from an old tv show “waking with dinosaurs” I can not wait to go see this on Saturday, it’s like the Harry Potter films no matter how old I get I still act like a child when it comes to a Jurassic park film😍😍"
"loved to see the cast, but o boi we got faster to the ''lets milk the story part"" than with for example the hunger games, at least they didn't split the movie in 2 to milk it even more."
Dinosaurs are reptiles and reptiles can’t survive in cold weather.
"I love this movie! If you haven’t seen it yet, I would highly recommend it"
Trash 🗑️
"Life, will find a way.so true 🤗"
"Spoiler***



This movie was not what I expected for a finale to the movies. 
  First off, having giant locusts be the possible demise of humans did not fit this movie. Sure, they were created from Dino genetics but at least make the human race in danger from Dino’s, it’s a dinosaur movie not a bugs life. An extinct virus killing humans, Dino human hybrids, or intelligent dinosaurs hunting people would have been a better plot related to the movies. The ending where Dino’s coexist with humans is what the movie started as, nothing actually happened in the movie after the locusts were stopped. I was expecting something more dramatic for an ending.
 Finding blue had a baby without a mate was interesting, but that plot went nowhere except Maisys origin. Are Dino’s going to keep replicating clones, are people going to clone themselves? We may never find out. 

Another thing that irked me was the feathered dinosaurs and dinosaurs living in snowy climates. You go from tropical islands with dinosaurs to turn living in cold areas and having feathers with zero explanation how and why. We want answers!

There’s got to be a new Jurassic movie trilogy or make a real final, final ending."
I hope they're going to make another Jurassic world domination part 3
I’ll never watch this trash movie again
"Just watched this... Gonna be honest. This was the worst jurassic park movie. First of all. I just cant accept that people live with dinos... In this movie there wasn't that jurassic park magic in it. It wasn't scary at all. No blood, jungle looks like 4x4 meter created set with 3 trees... Dinos look like mechanic creatures like 30 years back... I was surprised that cgi wasn't that good... Also story was pretty bad. I remember that I loved 2015 Jurassic Park movie... This one was not even close to that.."
So the directors forgot that their is another dinosaur island called site B from J3
"The best part about this movie was the red head, I have  a crush on her"
Steve jobs villain hahahaha
I love watching every Jurassic movies
Are there enough Dinosaurs of color and LGBTQ+etc  Dinosaurs to please the libs?
"What were you thinking, plot is trash acting abysmal (apart from Chris pratt) piece of advice an extreme diversity cast doesn't make the movie magically good.."
"Just rented it last night for my daughter’s birthday.
I have to say that I was disappointed. 

Great to have the old cast. The movie was just way too busy, though. They tried too hard to have about five different stories going on at once, and wanted to show off too many different dinosaurs… so that each one of them only got about 1 minute of useless screen time. They should have just picked 1 or 2 new dinosaurs and gave them major plot points like the previous movies.

Then… the movie’s theme was about dinosaurs loose on the earth, but they tried to tie it together with another “stupid corporation” that STILL hasn’t gotten it, and their agenda. The audience is honestly tired of seeing a giant company trying to own the dinosaurs. It’s overplayed now and they should have just stuck to what they showed in the early trailers… a world filled with dinosaurs where the humans have to find sone way to survive."
This movie is fucking trash. Over paid actors running around looking like they directing traffic... pathetic
"Disappointing or not, this is still the greatest dinosaur movie of all time. This should not be the last, keep doing and dont let the grumpy critics say what's what. Let the watchers just enjoy this epic franchise!"
"Пора говорить ПРЯМО, ВСЁ!!!! ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ , имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ  к ПОКАЯНИЮ-СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ!!!!, и соответственно наоборот, максимально УДАЛЯТЬ от него. 

Смысла у данного фильма никакого нет. Никаких динозавров в наше время не существует и не может существовать. Тут дело вот в чём. После грехопадения Адама и Евы они были изгнаны из РАЯ. До грехопадения они жили в РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и они получили ЗАПОВЕДЬ «Плодитесь и размножайтесь» и заселяйте Землю. И надо сказать что Земля на тот момент времени была полностью подобна ЦАРСТВИЮ НЕБЕСНОМУ(РАЮ). ""Каждая тварь получила по паре"". Только за одним исключением. Каждой твари, в том числе и человеку, пришлось добывать себе пропитание самостоятельно. Ну а к чему привела самостоятельная жизнь человека, наверно все слышали. ВСЕМИРНЫЙ ПОТОП. Вот тогда то(а не от некого ""большого взрыва"") и погибли окончательно(а возможно и значительно раньше, в результате опять же жизнедеятельности человека того времени)  все динозавры. И в то время  произошло значительное изменение климата. Вот поэтому, в климате подобно нашему динозавры уже никогда бы  и не смогли бы существовать. 
Но мир тогда не погиб окончательно. БОГ дал людям ""второй шанс"". И на Земле,  для СПАСЕНИЯ людей, родился  СЫН БОЖИЙ ИИСУС ХРИСТОС (Имя ИИСУС, кстати означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ).  Но это уже другой этап существования человека на Земле. Но, К СОЖАЛЕНИЮ, и этот этап  уже завершается. Но подходит уже к полному и  логичному своему завершению. А почему,  возможно будет понятно из того что написано ниже.

Ну а чтобы  каждому человеку выполнить главное предназначение его ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, это СПАСЕНИЕ( под СПАСЕНИЕМ понимается СПАСЕНИЕ ДУШИ человека от АДА после физической СМЕРТИ тела) необходимо ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА, а также для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО  ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что времени осталось мало, примерно 3 МЕСЯЦА, и ВСЁ) СДЕЛАТЬ при ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, первым, но ВЕРНЫМ шагом будет ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ.

Для того чтобы УСКОРИТЬ!!!!!!  ПОНИМАНИЕ  МОЖНО также ВОСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬСЯ информацией ниже.

Для тех кто НЕ ВЕРИТ в БОГА, или ВЕРА его СЛАБА, НЕ БОЙТЕСЬ!!!! ВОСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬСЯ этим ПРЕКРАСНЫМ СОВЕТОМ НАШИХ ПРАВОСЛАВНЫХ СВЯТЫХ ОТЦОВ, для того ЧТОБЫ РАЗ И НАВСЕГДА ВСЁ ПОНЯТЬ. Даже самые ЛЮТЫЕ АТЕИСТЫ, становятся ВЕРУЮЩИМИ В СВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ ЛЮДЬМИ. Но в любом случае НИЧЕГО НЕ ПОТЕРЯЕТЕ, если ПОПРОБУЕТЕ!!!!.
Совет таков. ВЕЧЕРОМ в тишине, В ДУХЕ КРОТОСТИ(НЕЗЛОБИЯ), обратится с ВОПРОСОМ, так как будто вы обращаетесь к ОТЦУ ОЧЕНЬ ЛЮБЯЩЕМУ ВАС, потому что БОГ ЕСТЬ ЛЮБОВЬ.  А вопрос можно сформулировать так: ""ГОСПОДИ ПРАВДА ЧТО ТЫ ЕСТЬ, И ТЫ ПРЕСВЯТАЯ ТРОИЦА: ОТЕЦ(СОЗДАТЕЛЬ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО и НЕ ВИДИМОГО), СЫН(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС), СВЯТОЙ ДУХ , и через дня три может пять , вы ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО ПОЛУЧИТЕ ОТВЕТ от БОГА, и НЕВЕРИЕ ваше ""ИСПАРИТСЯ"" НАВСЕГДА.
Можно попробовать  вечером перед сном , перед ИКОНОЙ например, можно и без ИКОНЫ. И НЕ БОЯТСЯ НИЧЕГО , потому-что БОГ, к нему НЕЛЬЗЯ!!!! ОТНОСИТСЯ МЕХАНИЧЕСКИ, ОН ЖИВОЙ!!!!, и ОН же не прячется от ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ОН всегда РЯДОМ, просто СТАЛ после ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА И ЕВЫ НЕ ВИДИМЫМ""

P.S. Почему УСПЕТЬ. ПОДУМАЙТЕ и оцените сами. Вот какая международная обстановка в мире. НАТО(Америка) и МЫ, РОССИЯ теперь официально враги . Украина скоро будет членом НАТО. И ещё несколько ИЗВЕСТНЫХ факта. Ракетные системы (ЯДЕРНЫЕ) Америки управляются АВТОМАТИЧЕСКИ, и то что недавно случилось в Фейсбук, ВНЕЗАПНОЕ ПОЛНОЕ ОТКЛЮЧЕНИЕ. А причиной этому был ИСКУССТВЕННЫЙ ИНТЕЛЛЕКТ. ИСКУССТВЕННЫЙ ИНТЕЛЛЕКТ дьявольское изобретение. Был СОЗДАН, БАНАЛЬНО по причине ОБЫЧНОЙ ЖАДНОСТИ, к которой непременно приводит СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ДЕНЬГАМ).   И то что ИСКУССТВЕННЫЙ ИНТЕЛЛЕКТ , уже давно как обыгрывает человека в САМУЮ ИНТЕЛЛЕКТУАЛЬНУЮ игру шахматы.

I will make dinos real if this is the last movie from Jurassic world and dinos would be free in the world 🌎 JUST WAIT LOVE JURASSIC WORLD AND DINOS
This could have and should have been so much better. BUT the chills I got when I saw the old characters..incredible. They should have had them in these new movies ALOT EARLIER.
"Not gonna lie to yall. This was pretty shit. The dinosaurs looked like shit. The acting was shit. But the worst part, the plot was fucking terrible. EDIT: The plot gets worse the longer you watch it"
The baby dinosaur is cute so this the one with a long neck
Is so cool you should make more Jurassic world movie Universal
Cool
"I finally watched this movie, because  I watched every Jurassic sequel. It was action packed and had sentiment in seeing all the characters. I remember 30 years ago watching the first epic and will always be my favorite one. I am though truly disappointed in the fact that Lex and Tim were not involved in this one. Who could forget when they were trying to hide from the velociraptors in the kitchen. we were on the edge of our seats. All of the actors in the first one all had outstanding roles that truly made it a epic film. Just a shame that they left out the two that made the first so memorable and remarkable."
"as an ARK player here, those dinosaurs are cute to befriend, they even do task for you and guard your house."
I love the entire franchise but this movie took a hot pile of shit on it. They even managed to mess up the reunion of the old cast.
"3 minutes in to the film,

i know realise the franchise is dead to me,

what a shame, the bait and switch of the trailers makes me not believe anything any more..."
This sucked. Full woke and a lot of garbage acting.
"This movie needed more dinosaurs. 

The returning cast was nice, but they were never the real stars of the franchise. The dinosaurs were."
I’m kind of disappointed. It felt so badly done and the acting was kind of bad too in my opinion :/
Workassic park. Good Lord. What a shitty movie.
wow allan grant is back
The only Jurassic movie from the franchise that I will never watch again. This movie is so boring.
Worst one out of the lot - 3/10
No le gustó nada que ver con las pasadas
"this movie is nonsense, so artificial and boring that I haven't watched it half way. for kids it might be ok, if i went to the movies for this it would be a waste of money!"
This movie was an insult to the intelligence of all those that watched it.
"Movie no ,,klapa,, movie 10/10"
Just watched this movie
Watched it tonight 💞 nothing wrong about film its amazing 💖
This is going to be epic and one of the good Jurassic films!
"I yawned my way through this movie at the theatre (not exaggerating one bit). The characters are all 2D one liners, the plot is non-existent, it’s a bunch of rah rah rah for kids between the age of  5-12."
Im so excited to see jurassic world and s5 jurassic world camp!! 😀😀😀
I hope they've focused on the story but Om prepared to be disappointed. My guess is they've put all the effort into action scenes and try to spice it up with nostalgia.
naaah bro these creatures are exactly the same as in ark bro i played to much of that game... the parasours te therazino the raptors LMFAO
Terrible plot and somewhat bad acting
I really hope this is the last Jurassic movie.It sucked balls.
লিক দেন
HES BACK
Class♥️♥️
this stinks
Why does it have to be the end
"Did they let Vin Diesel direct this movie? No exaggeration, worst movie I’ve seen in a few years."
5 minutes into the movie and I can’t take it anymore. They just ruined the franchise. How the f did they get everybody to star in this film. Just like the latest Harry Potter with Jude law who I absolutely love they ruined Harry Potter for ever. Stop f$&@ing all my favorite movies. Is so afraid to see the upcoming Indiana Jones movie. I’m going to stop watching new movies and keep rewatching my older favorites.
This movie sucks so much balls if you think it’s good you have bad taste in movies
I’m going to see this movie tonight at 8:45
CHRIST 325 MILLION YEARS OF DINOSAURS AND GENETIC ENGINEERING BUT CANNOT TAKE THE BITCH OUT OF LITTLE GIRL AND SHOW HER HOW TO USE EYE BROW TWEASERS..
"Movie was pretty damn lame. 
Hope they never make another one."
"An absolutely embarrassingly horrible atrocity!
 4 out of 10 stars 🌟 

The franchise is simply just being milked for every last drop at this point, and it has become in-your-face obvious. 

From unnecessary dialog, to missing necessary dialog, to ridiculously hilarious chase scenes, to laughable rhetoric filler content, this movie has all the aspects of a vintage B Rate cult classic horror comedy... except that's not the direction they intended.   

Heck, the creators even managed to sneak in the cliche` evil Mastermind villain - complete with high tech gadgetry and an army of prehistoric dinosaurs, as well as the cliche` freelance black market mule pilot used to connect the dots between plots, a mutant child, and the ever growing usage of a teenage girl that's somehow the key to saving the world....  this part alone has been overplayed 300x in every movie since the Hunger Games.  It's time to for something original.  During one particularly bad dinosaur scene with Chris Pratt wrangling a Dinosaur, you could actually see the real horse laying under the CGI over-layed on top of the horse to create the dinosaur. VERY lazy! 

Lazy story line arch, completely predictable story development, strangely uncreative use of dinosaurs roaming society (they could have done so much more with this), people surviving a unsurvivable plane crash (I'm a pilot),  stereotypical usage of a damsel in distress, you have some women destroying everyone's plans yet people ignkrantly still willing to work with them for the sake of the plot, Dinosaurs are implied to be everywhere amongst society and people going about life normally despite being killed constantly and the world Governments nowhere to be seen trying to eradicate the problem. 

Combine all that with horrible character development, sometimes none at all, mix it with more sub-plots than could possibly be used in 50 movies combined, add a pinch of Dr Grant, and try to save the day with Chris Pratt, and you have the movie in a nutshell.

You'd have to be a teenage adolescent to enjoy a movie this horrible."
l am going to the cinema with my mum to wacth this 🎦
Well it was an okey movie but nothing special. . Cool Dinasaurs but even a fake dinosaur documentary can be better than this xD The story wasn't great at all. And the black girl was so bad like i wanna look like a badass. . . It really left me with an OK feeling. xD
Is this a movie or a documentary after a hour a swith off
such an awful movie. atrocious stuff... shameful that anyone could make such a steaming pile of Dino dung..... this is literally only fit for the bin
Why did it feel like a dummed-down version of all the Jurassic movies combined? This is literally the most sleepy movie I've seen...
"BETTER I WATCH DORAEMON MOVIE
RATE FILM = -5/10 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Just saw it. Full of wasted potential,even JP3 was better
.Dogdson is pathetic, boring with no personality 
.Returning JP characters not enough to save it
.No real emotional impact
.Unrealistic dinosaur behaviour
.No real suspense or tension
.More focus on locusts than the bloody dinosaurs and doesn't even focus on the consequences of dinosaurs out and about in the human world.
.Things that don't make sense such as Malcom working for Biosyn 
.No memorable quotes 
.Poor acting
.They try to build up on the Giganotosaurus but it barely does anything and doesn't kill anyone, the combination kill is dumb and only makes you sympathetic to it. 

Good/ok points
.The end scene is good to look at, I liked the Mosasaur and whales and Elephants and Sinoceratops
.Dilpho comes back
.There's some cute baby dinos

 it's time to bury the franchise like the real fossils"
Corny and distinctly average.
Ok I'm going to watch this. I'll throw all scientific knowledge out the door and watch the movie that should make it enjoyable. I'm not looking for a science show here anyway
Hopefully this will be good and not boring and corny.
"This is the last movie of the series?  What a weak ending.  I watched the movie last night and it was just uninteresting.  If the original Jurassic Park was a 10, this one was a 2.  It would have been a 1 without having some of the original characters in it.  Brining in an imaginary new character like we should remember the mom (that didn't exist) from an earlier movie.  Weak.  Dogson as some evil mastermind?  Extremely weak.  The whole movie felt like a lazy attempt to wrap up the series.  If you are going to spend that much money on the actors and special effects, at least hire better writers.  I wouldn't spend another minute of my life rewatching this. Each movie in the series has gotten progressively more ridiculous."
The CGI doesn't look good
I will stop playing and watching in a full
The silly synth trumpet sound and dino vocalization footage at :26 made me laugh
Am sad that I has to wait for this stuff gluey can’t it just be finished in a day lol
"shit movie, shit acting, shit dinosaurus"
This movie was a horrible POS that made a mockery of everything that came before it.
Terrible film - worst out the whole series….barely any action with dinosaurs and poor “evil” storyline lol had Steve jobs wannabe as Villain 🦹‍♂️ 😂🤣
Hands down the worst movie of the year I've seen
Is this new movie jurassic world 2022?
Jurassic World and the second one is exciting but the 3rd one might be so boooring!!
I don't want to watch this stupid  movie stop showing up in my feed this movie is trash and it's garbage.
This stupid trailer is super misleading
Thought I was gonna see a Mixed breed of a cat and a chicken 🤣

"Well, the only good scene in this movie was the Malta part."
Idk I felt like the actors were half  assing their performance in this movie
"Rotten movie full of gender ideology! I miss the old movies where they didn't appeal to politics. Now, in these new movies they want to shove this damn homosexuality down the throat at all costs.🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"
"Lol all of a sudden black people are the smartest most cunning people in the world.  Lol “wake”
Up please"
"I have to say, the movie was pretty meh, at best
The Giga design disguisted me
Otherwise, there is so much more wrong with this movie, but I dont wanna write a paragraph here
What I do have to give them totally credit for, is the use of pratical effects
Lots of pratical effects were used and that also very well
But please let the Jurassic series rest now, it's enough already"
0/10 waste of time it's  a 🗑 ...
https://youtu.be/LF8jt6tgq80
Check out Jurassic Park on Oculus as well 👍✌️
IMO Worst Jurassic created…market scene was best part BUT DONT WORRY they will make more  they have to keep the narrative going to make people believe and there cognitive dissonance that dinosaurs actually existed lol
And it is the end of an era🥺 thankyou❤ for making our childhood awesome with adventures and Dinosaurs 🦖🦕......... And emotionally 🥺ends with bgm https://youtu.be/BXsWn9DhF5g
This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Hard to believe that they messed up every single scene and every single dialogue...
I give this movie a 1 out of 5.   story line was not that good.  the best part was that they brought back the people from the first movie. I don’t think the dinosaurs could live in the cold weather.
"Worst movie of the summer, I should have waited until 2023 to see it free."
"This is the worst of all the jurasic park movies.
In my opinion, it should not have been in theaters."
Me and my class got to see the premire :D
I haved see it on 19 June its a good movie
wtf is this shit? :D looks like tim coock got some dinosours in postapoccaliptic world :D
It was sad a script that I think a child did whiteout any story a great beginning and a sad ending of jurassic
Hi my name is Daniel I want to say I am big fan of the cast I would to meet the cast for a photo for my future
"This movie doesn't make much sense.. ONE park/island filled with animals spread across the WHOLE world?
All of them would have been killed within the next few borders..
Do you know how many hunters we have globally? Give them the green light & let the prehistoric fun begin."
This film was Corny......
"Just watched this movie. I gotta say, the most meaningful part of the movie is the end scene. The rest was decent but the end actually made me think."
12 minutes is about all I could take. what a stupid fkn movie
just a bad movie....
At this point I’m fed up with Chris Pratt and his magic hand able to tame any dinosaur by teaching out like he is a Jedi master
"This is without a doubt the worst jurassic movie. Too much people and training and too little dinosaurs.
Also, T rex deserves much better.
This was a big disappointment.
Horrible."
"The first two movies were based on  novels written by Michael Crichton RIP, so the stories and quotes are still amazing. After that, JP has become commercial projects without imagination and more about graphic. They didn't rely on how handsome the main actor

The first movie was about using science incorrectly and the good intention wasn't enough, 
Here, the director wanted to create suspense in the day light and in the middle of beautiful city, he just can't do that."
BOOOOOOOOOO
My family has seen less of me because I'm too young
"This movie is a nightmare, there are 10 000 actors and everybody has a fking bad acting it's insane and the storyline I mean it's a joke isn't it ? The villain at the beginning who thinks she's James Bond, the girl who takes them on a plane who is useless throughout the whole film, the villain from the lab who dies in the worst way possible, the 15 year old girl who is afraid of nothing and goes into danger as if nothing was wrong and adults let her, the black guy from the laboratory who has a non-existent script, we wonder what he's doing there, the old actors who were supposed to be the legends of the series are thrown into a terrible script, in short, there's a lot of stuff that's still wrong, I could continue for hours. At the end scene where they are all reunited, we have 0 emotion, we are in front of a bunch of clowns, it could be a space pandas movie with the same end scene it would be the same. Sorry but they've ruined Jurassic Park with this final movie, I will stick to JP 1 & 2 personaly, after that nothing happened to me lol"
I love how we still have the old characters from other jurassic worlds and jurassic park
Went to see it yesterday. Horrible movie. It was literally about nothing. Very disappointed to see one of my favourite franchises go to shit
"am i stupid or isn't there a big flaw in the plot? shouldn't they just have killed them all when they started to escape, except for a few for research purposes?"
I just watched the movie like 5 minutes ago. It was amazing.
This episode is really2 dumb all of time bad episode. Pls don`t watch it is you will wasting time
"I went to see the movie yesterday with my friends, and after the movie my friend told me I was laughing so much throughout the whole movie, even the end"
"ALMOST had me. Dinosaurs in the city = great idea. Old cast = awesome. Unfortunately, they didn't do much with that. Sad to see."
If you haven't seen the movie I Dominican ram you should go watch it it's very good they bring all the old characters from the first movies
Too much excessive computer graphics
01:03
"Movie without Dr.grant 😞
It's very sad to heard this one is last movie💔"
And the Oscar goes to this Trailer director.
I think this is a problem for some of the movies out there: The trailers are better than the actual movie
seriously what did they want to prove with this shit ? like seriously why did i watch this movie lol
THIS PART IS MORE A VIDEO GAME THAN A MOVIE .. HORSESHIT
02:41
Baby of the Blue is so sweet. I like him.😍😍😍
"Another worst movie out of the pipeline following nwh, resurrection"
Dinosaurs.. in the snow...               what the...
I liked it but my only gripe is the girl never faced any punishment for releasing the dinosaurs
i saw this movie so fucked up and don’t remember a single thing from it. great movie
"Trash.....like most of the movies nowadays.
All i see is political correctness and a trash script."
I could watch this all day!
Even this trailer looks better than the movie Jurassic World Dominion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnoNeMlNeD0
"What a rubbish movie!! Those were 2 extremely long hours.  I miss the first jurassic Park.  
The actors finish every scene with a always very cool phrase , to the point that is annoying. I hate it.
Then they look at each other all the time like one needs to aprove what the other just did , aaaarrghhh. Just awful"
Super flop
"The original ""Jurassic Park"" movie was good in 1993 and the last movie in the franchise ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is going to stink badly in 2022."
This movie is an insult to the Jurassic park franchise
What a train wrek!!! JP my all time fav movie! Jurassic World was amazing too! Really did not end this well or do the Character arc any Justice! Can't say I will add this to my collection! Why! Just Why!!!!!
You're not gonna believe it -- it's much worse than you expect it to be.
Flaap hai
This Movie Is Not As Good As Jurassic Park Movie
"I can just see the movie meeting, ok we have a series about dinosaurs, let’s make the plot to stop giant locusts. Yeah that sounds brilliant! 😂😂. You cannot make this up how bad this movie is. Unfortunately I expected nothing less. Horrible story lines full of CGI, standard of movies these days"
"I just finished the movie...... Sorry people but as i director, i can say, that was the worst Jurassic movie i ever seen.
2 hours and half, i watch it yesterday for the first time, and in the middle of movie, i was felt asleep. 

No respect to fans, dinosaurs turned to supporter roles, than mains, i loved when the old cast was back ( they made Malcolm's role, exactly just like Jurassic Park, but i prefer his role in Lost World ) also the scene when Rexy came back to life and fought Giganotosaurus. 

It was a "" good "" movie, but i can't rewatch it again ."
masaterpiece!
I couldn't believe how bad this move was a complete disappointment
Don't waste your time like me.
I heard this movie is a pile of dinosaur shit.
worst Jurassic movie EVER!!!
I watched that movie and guess what y’all I got scared and almost Cried 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Flop!!
"In 90s, Jurassic Park was scary horror movie 

Now it’s for children only"
Nothing like the original film...not even near...
I'm so sick of this trailer.
What an awesome movie. It gets your heart beating! I watched it in 4DX and it didn’t disappoint 🍿😅
I never felt any danger for the main characters cause I knew they would live they all had plot armour on.
it is not really a Jurassic park movie..which should be about dinosaurs......but about some stupid locusts threatening crops....totally ridiculous idea with misleading trailer.....  in theatre I was wondering what on earth is happening in this movie....seems that writer of the movie was on some kind of drug.....they could have shown how introduction of dianasours challenges local predators
I think I inured myself from rolling my eyes so much while watching this movie.
Literally jurassic world+Sci fi+Indiana Jones+call of duty chase mission
"The old farts are back, BUT this time, with MANDATORY black persons near them....what a waste of time was this ""movie"" 🤮💩"
"First half movie must have been directed by the advertising department, there was no story pacing, and each scene flowed like a commercial rather than a film."
I didnt find  the 1:04 mins scene in the real movie..
this is the worst jurassic movie corny acting trash scenes what else yea weak story nothing new
Waste of money . Kids movie now to much cgi aswell. Good to see the old actors though.
Yes this will be the last. Just like King Kong and Godzilla movies were the last.... Not! Follow the money
After watching the movie i wondered: Is that the end of the Jurassic series?
"How this movie got past editing without seeing how mind numbing stupid this is , is beyond me. I felt bad for them. Is there some weird plot where nobody kills a dinosaur? Or some forcefield around main characters? The constant freezing when a dino has it target in its sights so they can scurry to slightly safer spots."
"This franchise could turn into Dino Tamer , Dino Hunter , Dino Rider , Dino Zombie , so many possibilities"
The hero of the movie Is a strong masculine LGBTQ  black woman that saves the original cast multiple times. Why am I not surprised.
"Turns out… this movie was dog shit, worst one of the series."
Nice to see a Therizinosaurus in this movie.
movie was absolutely garbage
"Jurassic World 3: Dominion will arrive on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc on Tuesday, August 16th, 2022."
This was a action movie with some dinosaurs in it. Not a dinosaur movie with some action. If they would make the story line backwards probably were better.
Did not deliver. It's not the same Jurassic Park as before. It's too bad because the CG's were incredible with these dinosaurs. This movie is going to be a bust.
Cows go moo
What a trash movie. It had so much potential and you just wasted it.
"Terrible movie, the worst of all. Acting is very weak."
"Shame this film was so shit,"
I found a cure to covid-19
"Gotta be honest, i walked out of that movie, story line was disappointing and also the CGI straight up sucked."
bad movie what a waste of time
I love this movie I saw it for my birthday.
Love the old moves of this the new one is great these people are great actors
shit movie
Wonderful movie lotsa Dino nice
This movie is an insult to the original. Utterly disappointed. ☹️
Bunch of lies here.
Really interesting.  Starts saying its been 30 years.  But no one has aged.  Amazing.
"I one thing I can finally say is the studio finally used the shaving cream can... when I saw the first movie. I thought to myself, there is a nice set up for the sequel. Instead they just went with the idea, there was another similar island. SMH"
They do not know how to make a Jurassic park movie. 🤦‍♂️
That Dar Man lady was featured here. 😭
Hope Spinosaurus will comeback
Waste. I could of did better🤣
I can’t wait for this movie
Stop making this francise its boring same old plot
"The script is boring, sorry but true. There's one good action scene in the middle, but the suspense and atmosphere isn't really there. Steven Spielberg should have directed all the films, the ones he directed were the best, especially the first one."
This movie sucks compared to the ones before
Straight up ass movie glad I torrented it
Watching Minions rn
"i will never be able to watch this movie in full, because i sleep under normal circumstances"
Chris Prait should be ashamed. Although this is like “JP7” My favorite childhood movie has been reduced to a steaming pile of dinosaur dung. Might be my favorite WORST movie of 2022.
Garbage film
"So when the woman is running, the raptor can't catch her, but when she is in a speeding truck, they're right on her tail."
"Ruined it with all the woke BS sprinkled in... We have a crack pilot, who's female of course and wait, there's more! She's not only a wahman, but she's black! Not only that, oh no no, she's also a lesbian! Ding ding ding, we hit to woke bingo baby!

It added absolutely zero to the story, just more LGBT woke bullshit!

Also, the hyperloop... 🤣🤣🤣

It would have been a great movie if not for all the nonsense... Good job I didn't pay to see it... 🖕"
Extremely dumbest scene have been shown in this movie ....flop flop flop
The first Jurassic World still remains the best one sorry this movie kinda let me down a little 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Lizards don't survive in the snow. Winter is an extremely harsh time for reptiles and amphibians in colder climates. As cold-blooded animals, exposure to even mildly freezing conditions can be fatal. Many northern species find places to overwinter that protect them from freezing temperatures by burrowing underground. Although dinosaurs cannot be genetically resurrected  either lol lol"
"Masses say 'the worst movie ever'and I second that. The rainforests are cutting down, planet's warming, illegal wildlife trade thrives and they waste millions of dollars on this shit!!!??? The highly untalented Colin trevorrow should find a day job and start paying the money back!"
"The countless identical super pointy nose jobs, and the womens hairdos on men, gave the film an eerie sci-fi horror vibe I wasn't expecting in a cartoon! The chosen ones will gush all over it!"
What crap.. please don't make anymore of these movies. You are ruining the good ones that were made before this garbage
Terrible movie
Walked out after 33 minutes . BORING!!!! where the wild things are was more exciting! And I'm talking about the book
When the trailer is better than the movie
🙄🙄🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱 ridiculous move
terrible CGI
...el acento del clon ...venia con el clonaje?...jojojojoj
"OMFG...jajajajajjjjjjjjjjjjajajajajaja...los directores deberian tener un margen minimo de conocimientos en fisica para hacer peliculas...deberia tener parametros fundamentales para considerarlos directores o guionistas...cuando Chris detiene al dinosaurio con una cuerda y la ayuda de la raiz de un ""arbol"" ...mi hijo de 10 años me mira y dice: That will never happen...jajajaja...sè que es una pelicula fantastica pero tienen que plantearse codigos...por favor...estamos en el 2020..."
This is not jurassic world it's Locust world
"1/10
I miss the old episodes from the 90's. They created much more with a more modest technological background.."
This movie was like my job could not wait until it was over way too long
Jurassic World Dominion? You Mean Cadillac and Dinosaur?
The wokegenda manage to get into Jurassic Park… sht 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Just saw the MOVIE its HORRIBLE BAD !
The clone child is a annoying complaining little brat.
I made it past the 15 minute mark of this shit show.... dont think ill ever watch the whole thing.... franchise dead as can be
"I give it a 4/10. Nothing spectacular, but maybe some of the sound quality from some dinosaurs sounded good, but it was okay. Cheesy ass lines smh, and giant lotus eating the crops lol, a woman who can fly any plane and has a serious look, out running a velociraptor 😂 . And you can't forget a cloned child!!! X-Men origin meets Jurassic World"
Life will find a way .. best dialogue ever
The StoryLine was super fake so disappointed why they created this kind of shits n burying the old good ones
This movie was stupid I couldn’t even finish watching it way too boring!!
You know i felt the new movies did the Jurassic world an injustice but since this is the last one i feel its only right to watch it!
Dr. Lewis Dodgson looks like Tim Cook and  Biosyn look like apple park. so nostalgic.
"This movie was a let down, the cgi in the first 5 minutes was amateur, the story for the first 40 min. was lame and uninteresting, the dialogue was cheesy, the scenes of dinosaurs running with mammals was laughable."
Still had fun despite the rotten tomatoes score. Maybe fast and furious and Jurassic can crossover after 10&11
ini film tentang belalang bukan dinosaurus....
1:47 wtf
"I just watched the movie.
It was awesome! Didn't disappoint at all! IT had family scenes, lots of almost eaten scenes,...
I personally loved it, some may disagree."
Was not happy how this movie ended up being only because I felt there was too much going on over noting I wanted to see more Like dinosaurs eating some humans eating the lions and having it look like we going extinct to find our way back to being the ones who could have it once again under control but that kiss was nice
god was this movie terrible
half-Minions …. Half- Minions everywhere 😳🤌🏻🔥
This is amazing
All these dinosaurs look sick
They dropped the ball on this one.....LAME!!!
"Really not the worst movie i seen, enjoyed it, but wouldnt watch it again."
"Spoilers Bellow




Wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. I was expecting more death to be honest."
"The first film is better then now it’s so different, there is just 5 minutes good scenes and that set"
"2:08  Damn son, we're getting low budget. Duct tape and a generic warning sign?"
Pure magical that the old actors are here in the last movie but I loved the series as a kid and I loved this movie more than anything 💜
Australian version of this movie is cut..   5minutes from the beginning for starters
"WOWWW 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the stupidest script EVER !
EVER !!!
So stupid, it hurts physically.
Somehow the people around the world and especially in usa don't have guns and they don't use guns anymore.
Of course there is no police forces and no army.
Ok.but you know, that you still can kill anyone of those creatures, right?!
And what was that scene with the deer in the forest 😂😂😂 ahhh ha ha ha ha
The deer will stay there,of course she will 😅😅😅"
What a great movie some scenes are just like the old Jurassic Park xx just WOW 👌
please no more
So Apple's CEO decided to switch to genetics business? how thoughtful 😃
The classical background music all over the fking movie killed me.
Amazing but not equal to before. Parts
"The 3rd movie sucks, the 1st and 2nd was the best."
Great to see the original trio. That’s the only good thing I can say about this movie. Talking heads phoning it in with puppets and bad cgi. It also has one of those terrible scores that just drones in the background and doesn’t fit what’s happening on screen. Everything seems low effort.
Affirmative action all throughout movie. Trailer is misleading. Glad I *found* this online first. Movies are going to be a thing of the past now

i dont want jurrasic world dominion to be the end i want more i cant handle the feeling of not seeing anymore jurrasic world movies
Watched it  -rating: 5/10
Third-class pathetic movie... Movie without a story and also the Last fight between dinosaurs was disgusting.... People won't watch the same every time....#UniversalPictures
"In the early 90's dinosaurs were re-engineered  based on fossil DNA., in a remote island.....few sequels later they were in San Diego and Los Angeles, few sequels later they were cloned and enhanced, few sequels later they are over the world, 2022
Next sequels maybe 2030, who can guess what'll  be ????."
I loved the trailer and the movie did not disappoint! Sure there were some meh moments but I liked the movie overall. 9/10.
Sorry but this is worst so far
"Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre."
"Jurassic World: Dominion es una película sin alma, sin una pizca de comprensión de la magia del original.  Esta película hecha para su propio bien no tiene originalidad en sus propios términos, no tiene respeto por los fanáticos de esta gran serie de películas de dinosaurios, y no tiene ni una pizca de mérito artístico para el género cinematográfico."
Very dumb movie…
"Cool effects and nostalgic actors? check
Writing that's hard to follow and makes no sense, driving complete off the lore? check"
Well that was good.
I TORRENTED IT AND STILL WANT A REFUND
can you say: ark survival evolved
why this movie has a shitty rating on IMDB? 🤔
nice!
"It's sucks, honestly don't bother if you're a fan of the original movie and cast."
"It should say ""experience an epicly stupid story""."
this must have been written by a a genderless woke ideologist with an underdeveloped brain
I like the othet movies much bettet
All this criminal band who sells separatists talking heads in people must be in jaiL!!!
"This crazy radi cal Mad coala from Perm Sea Cliff downing street sells probably lenses for global slavery in stolen digital copy of diana spenser body with their heads attached to. They are radicals and separatists who negotiate in their heads, that is why they stole Diana Spencer digital copy of body as a host. ... ,,"
Turns out that the ecological disaster WASN'T THE DINOSAURS BRO
Left at min 40. This movie trash can water in my opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️
The giganotosaurus and therizinosaurus making their first appearance was awesome!
"Jesus..the most boring,stupid and idiotic movie in the series ! almost felt at sleep !"
it is gona a Blockbuster movie
Just watched it. The worst jurrassic movie ever.
I hv watched it just NW. It's amazing. I love it😙
Fucking terrible movie.
"just watched the movie and idk why critics are giving it such a hard time, the movie was great. obv not the best one in all Jurassic films, but it's not as terrible as everyone make it seemed. It's enjoyable seeing the og leads with the latest ones."
Looks like PETA took over this one.
I was very pleased that a gay lesbian theme was added into this dinosaur movie
"Maan,thy grphics would be better than before"
"What happend to movies? What happend to casting proper cast for movies. This movie is not good, the first thing is just the whole start of the movie. The second thing is did anyone else get super thrown off by the heavy british accent? You're used to that little girl american accent. It totally didn't match the scenes, the mother with her gentle american voice, and then this robust british accent replying back.

Pretty sure the watchers know that dinosaurs have taken over the world, there is no need to cast a british girl in the movie to potray that people are fleeing from their home countries.

I'll keep adding.

Well turns out that lil girl is a creation, still... Keep British actors in British movies this throws off the movie by a large margin."
Where did ALL those dinosaurs come from??? There wasn't THAT many dinosaurs bro lol
This has got to be the MOST cringe Jurassic Park movie I’ve ever seen and I’m only 5 min into the movie. If I paid for this I’d want my money back. What an utter embarrassment. How did we get here INDEED!
Last movie they said it's the last one. This time also they said it's the last one. How many last ones are gonna be there?
"I really don't know what did u expect I got there with low expectations because of the comments but it was actually pretty good!The storyline was ok the soundeffects insane it had some jumpscares ,the old cast and guess what•DINOSAURS"
What a shitty Movie is this
"Hi,
There was a mistake in the minute 1:45:00 when they were in the woods and the car flipped over and the lights were off but in the second shot when they were about to get out of the car the lights were on.  I didn't expect them to forget that mistake."
"Soulless drivel ,terrible acting,none of the original magic 😢"
I was just frowning the entire movie.. from the start it keeps getting worse and worse
Chris Pratt seemed soo unmotivated LOL
Full Movie Link: https://oke.io/ZtjnphLK
The wait is over
This movie is sooo BETA male - soy boy shit. There’s more logic in a role of toilet paper than the story in this movie. 👎🏼
"this movie is a complete garbage, a big disappointment!! it feels like watching James Bond+Mission Impossible+Fast&Furious+some random dinosaur scenes. who’s with me??"
i can't seem to find a place to see this online in good quality and it is still in theaters
"Horrible cast, except the old one and poor story."
"Dinosaurs never existed, fam. Richard Owen is a mad scientist for this. 😂 Cool film though. 🙏🏾"
"WORST SH17 I've seen in years. Plot was written by a 7 year old, so many ridiculous scenes, I've lost count. Waste of time to watch this crap."
Honestly...boring...and too long...drawn out and ...3 yawns.
SOME DUMB COMMENTS HERE THEY CALLED THEM SELVES A CRITIC 💩💩💩
Another ECO Socialist propaganda from #Hollywood
"All because of one stupid clone child , can't tolerate one more bs movie"
"Great to see the old cast again ,but older now they can’t run fast enough ,they nearly got eaten,what an adventure they are on ,a mission ,a world in the balance movie .well done."
"I love Pratt, but this movie is total trash. Very sad."
Ark reference kinda idk
What a shit movie its not Jurrasic park/world anymore
Straight up garbage!
What a utter waste of 2.5 hrs!! If this is the best Hollywood can offer then they're finished. Just more regurgitated drivel because they're too lazy to commission new ideas!
"Just add Dominic toretto in this movie, and you can name it Fast and furious.."
non less expected than this.just the way that film shows how great is .
"This was... TRAGIC to watch. Worst movie of the year, the shallowness of the plot, characters, Chris Pratt's performance give me legal rights to demand money for the time wasted and emotional distress caused."
"Quite boring.
Extremely stupid premise, it would take police army etc literally a week to shot and kill all the dinosaurs."
"OK,,, here ya go.... Get Over it people, Get over being a critic and bitching and complaining about ""the story line"".  Give me a freakin break, this is a MOVIE, it's meant to entertain, and take people away from all the BS in the world.  Take a break, watch a movie and just relax. LOL     Just be a casual viewer and enjoy the break.   Once again, it's just a MOVIE."
Honestly The movie Was not that bad...But No good neither the Story was Linear was full Packed Of action But I like How they maked Return of old Unique Characters
THEY. DID. NOT.
"I saw the movie today! There is no story line! The bad guy was not even that bad! He sucked at it! It was a strange actor. No story and to much new actors. Seriously I love all the juressic movies, but this time they failed... The writers should have come up with something better."
"ARK:Survival Evolved, starring James Reece."
"Finally they add a dino that has feathers
Really close to how dinos used to look like"
This gonna be an epic film ever 😎
Am I the only one that is seriously disappointed that they didn’t bring back the kids from the first three movies??  They would’ve made the final movie so much better.
Im watching the movie on my computer in HD 720p so I understand if the quality is not at its full potential but I have to say that it looks more like a action shooter movie than a jurassic world film. Its like seen 007 movie with dinosaurs...what are you doing ?
dino3

"It's funny, the only people who really enjoyed this movie are 15 year olds and younger. It seems like this was made for kids. Really good CGI, dinos looked great, but the story was horrible, filled with plot holes and didn't do the original cast any justice by giving them a shit script to work with. There is nothing wrong with a dino movie for kids, but this was suppose to be the finale to one of the biggest franchises. The original jurrasic park was a movie for everyone. Kids and adults. If you are an adult watching this movie, you need to have no expectations, and go into this movie for nostalgia."
"My girlfriend and I watched the movie not having seen any of the trailers and we had a great time! It's a nice movie to watch with the family. Its too bad other people didnt like it, I guess I get why some would be disappointed but I watched without having much expectation other than 'a dinosaur movie' and was pretty entertained by the film. Great action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat, has good wholesome moments, has suspense, has a decent story, and a good cast. No useless characters and the story had good progression. I cant think of scene that didnt add any value to the story. a solid 7.5 / 10"
Ayo i always come back:meme springtrap says:i always come back
I saw the movie and this still gives me chills and goosebumps.
#NAME?
"I love Jurassic movies, but.... why would these animals attack so often? 
Unless you stole it's baby or it's egg and it knows you have it, they would have no reason to follow these people for so long. 
Kind of sick of movies that go on the premise that animals can eat and eat and eat and are never full. And, that they attack for no reason. 
Lol, it's like watching the game Ark I play. Dinos are never full and always attack XD."
Jesus Christ Pine us turned all upstairs into double cinema chairs?
Spooky dinosaur
Gonna watch this tomorrow!!
victor siger at det er en banger trailer
"This movie will definitely be an impressive movie for those who like the Jurassic series. However, it was a movie that left a lot of regrets as a movie that embellishes the beauty of the Jurassic series."
Movie is boring af 😒
Yeah this movie was rough to watch. Did not like it at all. It was so boring and the dialogue was very poorly written. Sentences that dont make any sense.
"Just saw this film in theater, quite good."
Is this boring or not
Logo looks like the Mortal Kombat logo.
Just finished watching this at the movie theaters. LOVED ITTTTTTTTtt
what was that one JP sequel where Jim Carrey comes out of the dinos butt?
2:08 - 2:40 . My favourite part of the trailer
What a pile of rethreaded trash
First movie I’ve walked out because it’s so boring
Was 1:05 even in the movie ? Looks like SAN Diego from The Lost World
In the end of this movie t rex and that another dinosaur fight looks the same as jurassic Park 2015
Nice movie
"I guess my disappointment may lie with the director of this film, as the story build especially the first reel, I just was not pulled into it. Acting was pretty good but the editing seemed hurried or the directing was lacking. I wish the CG would put more emphasis on building in more realistic applied physics (mass, momentum, density). But I am a senior an I expect more story quality and not so heavy on the comic book style of film. But that’s just me maybe, I went to motion picture school sometime ago. And in my theater the sound seem low fidelity for some reason. Oh well, have fun."
"These were my disappointments:
1. Spinosaurus and Ceratosaurus didn’t appear in the movie.
2. Lex and Tim weren’t in the movie. 
3. The T-rex, Blue and the Mosasaurus had barely any screen time. 
4. The T-rex and Giganotosaurus showdown was too short and rushed."
Just saw the movie and it was awesome!
I haven’t watched it but I think it’s a good movie
It was pretty cool it did suffer because of the long ass runtime but yea there’s plenty of dinosaur action in here. I don’t expect much from the plot or narrative or even the actors but it was stable enough to keep the movie going.  Overall an entertaining movie would watch again
Omg I thought blue died I'm so happy he is back🤩🤩😃
"The most boring movie of the year. The Elvis Presley movie looks bearable after watching this. There’s more talking than actual action scenes in the movie. Wish I could leave the theatre rn, but I’m stuck here trying not to fall asleep. Do not waste your money on this movie!"
Oh my God em so excited the old cast with the new one!!!!
I think I need a movie like planet of the apes but with dinos next! Rise of the planet of the Dinosaurs or Jurassic planet ya that will be good!
The story was very disapointed
Jurassic World Dominion is responsible for all the election frauds.
Legend says that they still roam
Movie sucked balls barely had anything to do with dinosaurs.
Can you PLS add spino in your next Jurassic world movie PLSSSSSS
I am Big fan New Jurassic world. so Good trailer  All Dinosaur very very good good character good  Like new Jurassic world Dominion  minion trailer
Looks horribly mid
I watch the movie jurassic world dominion it was amazing my birthday is gonna be jurassic world dominion its so amazing im turining 9 in frebruary 19 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Good movie but the melanated girls character was a little over board with her choice of words linking her to someone who grew up in “ the hood “
"Worst movie ever . Complete bullshit, it's basically the first movie all over again . Little to no effort put into the script or new scenes"
so many different plots you could have taken just WHY WHY WHY HOLY SHUTSDRG MER YNJKsdrfgbJsedrgbhjGHUIr huip;
Shouldn't dinosaurs die in that cold temperature
"I saw the movie and I have a question not 1 but many, did all the actor's really run faster than the dinosaurs, I think t.rex dino can run up to 40 to 50 mph."
Dr. Grant has his beard! 🧬 Love to see Dr. Malcolm is back! 🧮
This movie was so boring i wanted to walk out of the theater but i already had paid 🥲
Love this
"my god this movie sucked.. plothole after plothole..  dumb things everywhere.. way too many fan-service things that just messed up the beat of the movie.. and what the hell was the story? (spoiler alert)

The only way to make things ""exciting"" was to have dino chase every 3 minutes.. that is all this movie is.. dialog, dino chase, dialog, dino chase, dialog, dino chase, fan service, dino chase, more fan service call backs. dino chase. t-rex boss battle (uuuuugh).. dino chase... one time the dino's take seconds to kill someone, but as soon as it's the main characters, they take their sweet time to make things ""exciting"" and toy/tease with the actors.. 

I also wonder how they managed to escape the dino chases. As some dino's in this movie have been shown to run at about 100mph for a good 10 minutes, being able to keep up to a plane that's taking off.. or fly 200 mph to keep up with a flying plane.. I mean.. seriously.. come one.. 

Or to have regular dinosaurs live in snow.... reptiles... in snow... REPTILES... IN... SNOW... maybe the feathered ones, but certainly not all the other ones. At least get that logic right...

And what the hell was the locust plot-line. They fix 1 and that will kill them all? because that's how the clone baby dna got fixed, so it should work for locusts??... Locusts aren't connected DNA strands and aren't connected unless that one locust is a love machine.. They don't work that way.. but i guess a boring hive-mind kind of thing had to be a standard plot.. ?

I'm also still trying to figure out how those 25 or so dino's, that escaped in fallen kingdom because of clone baby, were such love machines and were breeding like bunnies to the point that 4 years later, we get thousands and thousands of ADULT (in 4 years) dino's everywhere, including new species. Because that's how love making works, do it hard enough and you get new species...

Hiding bad plot, bad logic, bad acting and bad stories with fan service with things like the old cast, call backs and boring action boss fights."
My childhood and this movie ❤️
"Don’t watch it, it was so boring I had to walk out."
Is it just me or did the locusts get stronger as they were burning? And how did the dead BURNT locusts revive from the dead because of sound?
omg gigannotosaurus
Dilophosaurus is back!
"I think the dinosaurs are tired of chasing you humans 
and they said ""you don't even taste that good""."
goofy augh film bro fucking Zheng veut mater ce film (Il a ete monte en Chine)
Agustinia and Amargasaurus should have been in the movie
Seismosaurus should have made an appearance
I watched it in my birthday June 28 and it is my favorite movie of all time! Loved the old cast!
"My favorite part was when Owen dressed up like peter quill and jumped out of a plane while yelling "" it's morbin Time"""
JUST GOT HOME FROM SEEING THIS MOVIE. THE WORST ACTING. WORST STORY LINE (NO STORY LINE) I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE AT THE CINEMAS. I STRONGLY ADVISE  NOT GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WATCH IT IN A YEAR AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN.
Humans is the real dinasor.
Laura Dern Sam Neill Jeff!! ❤️❤️❤️
Anyone else notice how the recurring leitmotif in these Dominion trailers is the first three notes of the original Jurassic Park theme?
Been with this franchise since I was a little kid and I love the fact that they are still around for kids nowadays. Can't wait to see the old cast come back and for all the new dinos! Love these films. Very excited for this film ^__A
"flinstones but horror version,"
Garbage film.
Bourgeoisie and workers can't coexist.
is this the new Ark movie ?
Sam Neil started it all. Back to finish it.. LOVE IT
this looks  incredible!
"This was mostly worthwhile when I saw it the day it premiered. And yet, despite all the extended time production went through, this movie failed to reach Shrek 2’s status as a sequel even better than the very first film in my eyes. Not to mention all of the applicable characters who were used too little or completely wasted (Blue, Zia, Franklin, Billy Brennan, Tim Murphy, Lex Murphy, Kelly Malcolm, Lowery, Vivian, Grey Mitchell, Sarah Harding, Nick van Owen, Eric Kirby, Paul Kirby, Zach Mitchell, and Barry. Oh man.)"
In a narration type voice “Dr.Grant and the crew come back together to help Owen take back WHATS there’s.”
bad movie
Raptors there ware not so big really.  There like a dog
"This movie was awesome.

It had issues, but it was still damn fun Alright.

Rotten Tomatoes don't know jack sh*t."
"Ok, I didn't like this one. There was no progression to the story's plot line and no overall conclusion. The world before the movie and after the movie is the same."
this will be dogshit
This movie was great!
You guys have to make more movies they are og
so this is the jurassic world end game...cant wait to see it
Jurasic park vs kong coming soon
I liked this movie
"Why is this movie so bad, it doesn't make any sense at all. You had a great franchise and you screwed it over by making men evil again instead of dino's. Oh and don't get me started on the locusts"
SHEESH
crap
"I’ve already seen “Jurassic World” on NBC and its sequel “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” at a movie theater 4 years ago; but this trailer brought me at intensity level because of the scenes w/dinosaurs. Anyway, I’m excited to watch this film. 🙂😊😀😁🙌🙏🤞🎥🎬🎞🎫🎭🌟🦖🦕⛰🌋❤️"
This is so cool!!😄
Just watched the movie today! It did not disappoint. Well done.
"Dude this movie sucked ! Pointless storyline, hollow characters, ridiculous dialog, cliches all over the place. This whole trilogy is crap"
Loved the movie! 🍿 🦕 🦖 🍿 My kiddo enjoyed himself 🖤 thank you. && it’s [[ amazing ]] that the whole crew came back and some scenes were recreated! L🖤VED.
"Let this franchise die already, milking it makes it worse. JP1, 2 and 3 remain to be the best Jurassic park movies."
"Now thats a trailer, didn't give too much away showed just enough, well done."
"The whole movie just looks like a videogame, sorry. Too much cgi."
They straight up just used Justice League Snyder cut trailer music
I say we get a T-REx and storm the Supreme Court!  Long live the T-REx!
"I’m so glad I didn’t spend money to watch this movie, the directors literally shat on your lap and laughed at your face for 2 hours and 26 mins."
"Went to see this with my wife at the US 23 Drive-In in Flint, Michigan with Top Gun. All I can say is it was all I could do to sit through this garbage. One minute Chris Pratt and another actress are on an ice filled lake (hundreds of miles from the other actors after a plane crash) and moments later they are back in a wooden hot humidity filled jungle that they walk to and through to find the others. Complete NONSENSE and totally unbelievable! I wish they had all got eaten! Top Gun was much better! Although both movies were about the same time in length, it seemed as if Jurassic World Dominion was eight hours long and Top Gun was an hour long. Jurassic World Dominion SUCKED!"
"I haven't seen it and don't think I will because nowadays they don't put detail into the realism and acting of Dinosaurs as like real animals as they did before in the first 2 films... Even the actors nowadays all seem soo forced and selected to model and act in a strange way, when before actors were like real scientists and archaeologists who looked like they study dinosaurs and acting was superior... These days there is just tooo much going on in a movie to make you say ""Oh come on man, yeah right as if that would all happen in reality""  extreme over the top action moments and cheesy cringe actor lines...

I mean just look at all these trailers nowadays too, fade ins and fade outs, over dramatic music and over dramatic scenes of all the hype ass scenes of the movie... Only for the easily pleased, who buy and take anything"
i love time
wow I'm a kid
Human and Dino can definitely co-exist. The dinosaurs will be just like the Komodo dragons but some bigger. Lol
Mantap salam dari Indonesia
"Its kind odd how the trailer makes you think theyre talking about ""Blue and Beta"" and how their a larger part of the storyline. Turns out Blue really isnt. Beta plays a role, but is second to Masie."
I even know what the some jurassic park  cereters there.
Is that flying pterosaur that attacks the plane  Quetzalcoatlus??!! That would awesome ❤️
That's my favorite movie
Plz make more jrassic world movies you guys are better then any movies ever
trailer is so well done though. love it
Asome movie I watched it in 4DX it was amazing must say the younger people will love it
What a pile of
"Let me sum up the movie for you;
reheated pizza, not as good as last night and a bit soggy"
"I wish they would kill off this franchise, Hollywood still milking the same garbage over n over"
"I wonder will giga,rex, and raptor be fuse into a new dino creature?!"
"Goodbye jurassic world the last film 😭😭😭 i watch it it was so good but this is the last movie of jurassic world 

Welcome to jurassic park 🦖"
When it's coming?
Colin did a great job with ROS . Oh wait
"Watched this movie twice. Not because I think it's good, I think it's ok.  But mostly I just want to lick the sweat off of Bryce Dallas Howards cheeks. They looked so salty and savory."
For me the story line was a bit disapointing. But the action scenes are soooo good and the little references to the first movies where very clever. I watched the first movie in theaters with my dad when i was 13 and the last one with my 13 year old daughter.. and that's pretty special to me❤
Tbh I’m 9 and watches this movie in the theaters today.
More Hollywood garbage!
Just don't waste your money on this movie. Half room in cinema was sleeping 😴.  The worst movie ever. They ashley  can get an oscar for the worst movie ever.
"How? just how did you mess this up so bad, it's like an 8 year old write his favorite dino movie, did you ruin it on purpose so no one would ever dare to reboot it?"
"Shown in:
Uncharted 
The Batman
Ambulance
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore 
The Northman
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 
Gary Thurman 3000
Top Gun Maverick"
"Spoiler Alert for those that still haven’t seen the movie so stop reading!!!

At 0:48 I love how we thought at first they were talking about Blue and Betta (the baby raptor)"
"They say ""epic conclusion"" like this franchise is ever going to end."
Best Jurassic movie ever I experienced Action scenes in 3D full paisa wasool... Bc 🥳
"Dinosaur king is what you wanna be yeah 
Go on make your move! 😂"
Well now that I know the entire plot.

This movie sucked and is targeted for chinese markets
"I love The Jurassic Park/ Jurassic World Movies but this one just does not live up to the others.

However, I do love Laura Dern, Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum"
"Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum dated in real life for a while after the first Jurassic, but they both went on to other people.
Nice to see them back together onscreen without the least bit of awkwardness in this final installment.
Laura has a sterling reputation as one of the nicest people to work with.
That quality def comes thru on the screen."
Absolutely shocking film
When I saw doMinion in the title I thought there would be minions looking for the best villain as the boss

Yes! Dinosaurs with feathers! It's worth seeing in theatres just for that reason alone.

This was their worst one.
wheww....this movie blew me away!  I believe it's the best one they made.  I watched it in 3D and I could barely catch my breath...the action is non stop.  They blended in several characters and payed homage to the older movies in a tasteful way.

Dinosaurs and humans could coexist the movie is wrong the reason they're having trouble in this trailer because they didn't have a plan they just picked them up from an island drop them off and expected everything to be hunky-dory like everything will be okay but because they didn't have a plan they f*** themselves anybody wants to argue with me I'm down I'm not in the f****** mood right now one of my family members pissing me off I'd rather really not argue but like I said if you want to I'm game you to have a plain if you dont everything gose to ruin
so cool i wish the nice dinosaurs were still alive so i am watching it at the movie theater i love the first one
"It's cool that there adding new dinosaurs, sad to see that the Dilophosaurus is made to look that way"
If the therinzinosaurus couldn’t survive what chance do we have?
"I watched the film, and it's amazing! The story with the giant bugs is very entertaining and interesting. 🤩"
Really milking it.
"film was rubbish , worst in franchise . trailer built it up"
Movie is trash
"I want a refund. You ruined a franchise by making this movie. I refuse to accept this. THE FINALE to a great franchise, and this is the SHIT YOU COME WITH? A movie about BEES ON STERIODS? AND A SEQUEAL TO TAKEN?? What the actual fuck? The amount of fucking plot holes in this movie is incredible. It has to be a world record. Nothing in this movie made sense, from characters appearing out of nowhere, to villians just fucking disappearing.. I mean, I can write a fucking novel on how bad this movie was. Damn. Also, It's comical how .. you know what, I'm done.. this movie was fucking trash."
"Not over jurrasic plzz
Come back new chapter jurrasic home movie❤️"
"I didn't realize how much I love to see pale face people get eaten by dinosaurs....""LOL""   It's really entertaining.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Can't wait for the next one..""LOL"" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. How come no one liked my comment. 'It's a joke"""
Lookin good
Jurassic Park is still the best
Bruh this tralier is so good and it was also a good movie for me it was SICK!
ASSALAMU'ALAIKUM WARROHMATULOHI WABAROKATUH ASSTAGHFIRULLAH DELET THIS VIDIO WASSALAMU'ALAIKUM WARROHMATULOHI WABAROKATUH 😡
OK I went to cinema to watch and guys this movie is sooooooo bad half of audience go out in first hour
Gwen Stacy with Peter quill not Parker 😂
DID HE SAY I ALWAYS COMEBACK
"This movie was pretty good. It was longer then I expected. I only watched it, because I saw those from the first movie. I was glad that they had more then a cameo in the movie."
Blue has a baby!?
I'm gonna be honest the trailer is better than the movie
BEST EVER
My son loves this!
wtf
Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
The movie was pure ass.
I don’t remember that T. rex at the cinema bit… to be honest the trailer is better than the movie….
Worst movie 😂
This movie was shit!
We just left the theatre 20 mins after the interval......we all felt sleepy the whole time..... Jurassic park is no more crazy now😕
"Terrible! kids movie, stupid, soap ."
Help pls! Do I have to watch any of the other Jurassic movies before I watch this?
Who have been watch it? How many start will u give out of 10
"Has anyone seen this movie?
Is it good?"
Ewwwhhh
The movie was bad 👎🏻
"A Sad ending to an once great franchise...........hollywood managed to destroy one more huge franchise like they did with S.W
 dinos with humans in big cities  ?
 couldn't they tell a story like the JP 3 story or smg like that  ?
 they ruined everything...."
I liked the part where Owen grady distracts the T rex with a dance off
"Why people has curiosity about about big sized animals rely upon giraffe ,camels n others ,go to zoo n watch Jurassic park live"
"YUP IT FLOPPED, I LITTERALLY MADE 2 COMMENTS ON THIS VIDEO SAYING IT WOULD FLOP 4 MONTHS AGO. WHAT A SHOCKER, IF YOU CANT COME UP WITH ANY NEW FOR THE TABLE LEAVE IT TF ALONE."
These movies keep getting more ridiculous and I keep watching them lol
"The storyline is not that intresting,i watch it cause it makes me feel that we humans were not the only beings that lived .........the suspense,history and the mystry"
"#Imo One thing that ruin this whole franchise is the take to emerging the human clone, like wtf they were into right now"
"I didn't get it, how did Owen and the other girl survived the helicopter crash?"
Way too much FORCED diversity it makes the movie kinda silly...
Behold the worst movie ever made
Best👍 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"I really recommend watching this movie!
Its so good"
Very nice movie i love this movie so much
"Not 1 active braincell was used, during the script writing of this movie."
afah iya
I think I have to accept that Jurassic World films are for kids and stop hoping for a tense Jurassic Park movie
The dinasoars are secondary in their own film that just sums up this shit bomb of a film
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Thought this might be a good movie.....boy was I wrong.  It sucked really bad.  Way over the top and not believable.  CGI looked old and outdated and the ""mixing"" of dinosaurs and mammals was preposterous.  I would give this 1 star if you are bored, but otherwise save your money."
Bruh they used the music from Zack Snyder’s justice league final trailer
Ist good
"when a red head outruns velociraptor raptors, that's when you know it's gonna be a game changer.   When a buff dude becomes the dinosaur speaker.  Jurassic World: dominates you in a nut shell."
"Honestly, I don’t know why the critics are being funny about this film. I saw it today and I loved it! Okay, so some of the chase scenes would be impossible in real life - I mean, in real life the dinosaurs would surely catch up with the humans every time - and maybe they could have done with introducing Alan, Ellie and Ian to Clare, Owen and Maisy earlier on in the film, but it was still a great story! And (spoiler alert) well done Rexy on being the dominant JP dinosaur in a fight once again! The only thing I criticise is Dr Malcom’s decision to keep his shirt buttoned up! 😂"
Me aj movie dekh ka a raha hoon kmal ki h
I thought he movie was awful. Don't let the dark theme of this trailer fool you into thinking you're going to watch an epic finale with a good plot
"Please don’t waste your time I. Can’t believe they spend money making this money smh 
One of the worst movies ever"
"The worst movie I ever seen don’t waste your time or money 
Omg it was so horrible I feel sleep woke up and left the theatre smh"
The movie it's good
2:30 iykyk

I love how they gatherd all up;) Some if the people are from the first Jurassic world! But it is sad this is. The last Jurassic world
Freddy: Get out of there Gregory 1:54
I like the movie
Ark survival the movie
"Am i the only one disappointed by the movie?The only good thing was the past actors coming back and probably the new dinos...All the rest was not touching...I mean come one...big grass hoppers?A trained raptor gives birth to her own egg...The giganotosaurus dies so briefly,no intense in the scenes,no explosion...I still remember the brachio from the 1st movie,goosebumps down my spine...The jp series total succes to me,a dream coming alive.The jw series weren t enough i believe,too bad..."
"Wow, more of your money down the toilet!

      The Truth about dinosaurs is they never lived on this planet. No, in actuality, ancient aliens were roughly 600 ft tall and bummed around in ships almost as big as this planet. What we perceive as dinosaur fossils are actually the remains of alien finger food, which have been discarded here millions of years ago after they were done snacking on them, thus the fossils indiscriminately dispersed all over the planet. 

    As it turns out, those giant ancient aliens hated the color blue. So they all decided that this was the perfect planet to dump all their snack refuse onto. They also decided it was the perfect place to masturbate in the oceans, thus jellyfish!

     Oh and that UFO they found in Roswell, that's actually one of their kids pull toys. Sam Neill is a Satanist and Tom Cruise is having a stroke right now since Xenu would use him as a salad crouton.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu"
"I hate how Hollywood destroys successful franchises by milking them dry with these lazy, repeat sequels and all the normie consumers that celebrate them doing so because they don't know any better."
please don't spend your money watching this it's garbage
boring ass movie
"Saw it last night. Well, they completely effed that up, didn't they?! Kingdom set it up so the third instalment could (should) have been about mankind living with Dino's 'in the wild', across the US. Nope, instead we end up with the Dino's back in a Park/Arena again. Also what was the point in building up the Owen/Blue relationship for it to be to be basically null and void in this film? I thought Kingdom wasn't great, but this elevates it!"
"Ngl i saw this trailer last march and was so hyped! I was like omg its a third one my childhood is happy and the trailer looks so cool!! When in reality last saturday i watched the movie with my fam and instantly, (spoilers ahead) the first scene was a Mosasaurus (if i spelled it right correct me if im wrong) scene. And it looked quite amazing i guess. Then the second scene came over. It instantly bored me. Like the first one i was really hyped (first movie) 2nd movie i was confused but still liked it, then my fam really loves jurassic park and was happy to see the jurassic park cast in it and.. its just overwhelming. My little brother loves dinosaurs including jurassic world but dominion made him bored. The last scene says the dinosaurs will just have to co-exist with us humans, it didnt give me the excitement i wanted to see, we were bored honestly. We also just saw a giant turkey. Overall its a 3/5 for me, i love how owen and claire is in a happy relationship adopting macy. And i love how the old cast were there too, but the plot is just boring like, i wanted to see how the dinosaurs are now like- i wanted to see how the dinosaurs are enjoying like did the dinosaurs eat every human? Did they rule earth again? But instead it was just an evil company they had to face, sorry my childhood self :""("
How the cold blooded animals are roaming around in Cold?
While all other countries are living normal lives just few americans vs thousands of dinosaurs!!!
This makes 0 sense dinosaurs got out of their enclosures in the 1st movie but dinosaurs didn't take over the world then so how did they do it in this movie and why can't they just shoot them they're still made of flesh and bone they're not bulletproof cyborgs.
we can  do like carnotausarus   the game  the game  tomorrow  Jurassic World dominion break from  Film  show  stupid stupid stupid
👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👌👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👌👍👍👌👍👌👍👌👌👍👌👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👍👌👍👍👌👌👍
"Hey cool, where can we request a refund? Because what's shown in the trailer depicts an entirely different movie. For those who haven't seen it yet, just wait for it to stream. Even then you'd be better off pretending Fallen Kingdom is the finale."
It’s so cool seeing Ellie Alan and Malcom again
Movie sucked if I wanted to watch a bunch of humans talking I would of watched espn first take
"1. Not everyone was in it like they said. 
2. Over hyped. Not to good 😕 
3. Not much new content or story.  
4. Few scenes cut out from the trailers. 
5. Wasn't to suspenseful or intriguing. 
6. 2.5 out of 5 stars 🌟 
7. Only cool thing was the  Gigananosaurus end fight."
Haven’t seen it but sounds like my initial hunch was correct- “a movie written by idiots for idiots”
Hiii... I made a BIG picture DRAWING Jurassic World Dominion.... It took me 30 DAYS and it was READY TODAY | It's here on the channel....
Worst movie I’ve seen this year
This movie suck so bad dinosaurs left to walk around people like it's normal not one human with a 50cal I know it's a movie but come on  make it little bit real
People should get paid to go watch this dumpster fire as a form of torture. What a load of crap!
"So I just watched this movie, who do I contact for wasting 2 and a half hours of my life?.. Absolutely awful, my nrxt question is, why the hell did they ever make this abomination. Don't believe the hype people, this is probably the worse Jurrassic park movie I've ever seen."
"Dinosaurs are real

 ....can't be"
"Not so good movie, at least they don't bring back that vegan teacher crush in jurassic park 2"
"Unfortunately disappointing movie, nothing like the previous ones, while watching this one it seemed like they couldn't afford the main characters, it was a mess, it was no more about dinosaurs, it seemed like they wanted to make a new star trek where dinosaurs are just a something plus to the humans, very disappointimg conclusions, I have left the cinema before film ended probably 40 minutes before, who saved the film for me? It was that black lady sorry I don't remember name and I can not be bothered to check it, she was hilarious, the best scenes were with that red haired girl, if the whole film was like that, the whole film was based on some cloning that I couldn't even remember from previous ones, bluse story seemed like it had to be put on just for the sake of it, in general VERY FUNNY FILM, one of the best comedy films I have seen when you make your own things in your head while you watching it, but personally I have wasted my money on this one, very disappointing story line for the ""conclusion""."
"Out of all JP and JW movie, Dominion is the most BORING and POINTLESS movie in the franchise."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o2S2UycbYM
An absolute trainwreck of the highest order.
It’s so bad but all jurassic world movies are after all. Raptors teaming up with humans. A prehistoric reptile feeling affection really? Just how retarded you have to be to prefer any of the JW to JP3. That movie is bullied in such an incoherent way. Jurassic park movies are to be ranked chronologically really.
This movie sucks I watched it yesterday
They're basically pulling a TROS on this one
Where can I watch this? Besides on a cinema
Just watch this movie yesterday. Not really good tbh
What an absolute garbage movie! Waste of time. Saw a dude just walk out halfway through. Movies like this give the entire franchise a bad name similar to Transformers 5.
How embarrassing.  The cant do any movies without the bizarrely placed black person to keep the cosmetic diversity laugh alive.  The black gal has no reason for being in this exccept.
This movie sucked
This is beautiful

Haven't seen it yet but really the only complaint I have is the dinosaurs being able to survive in a snowy terrain (since they're cold-blooded and that would likely kill them) 😅
What a great movie and conclusion. I enjoyed it
One of the worst movies I've ever sat through
I swear 99% of AAA movies being released nowadays are a waste of life
This trailer was better than the whole movie
awesome film
This film is always about raptors and t-rex
"The best of the movie, the trailer! What a way to extinguish and destroy such a blockbuster and denied saga that I am! Spielberg how have you allowed the end of your saga to be made with this Trevor movie hogwash?! Please make another one and let JABayona do it"
This film is so insulting
This film is such shiiite
"No Way

"Just watched the movie today. I liked it alot even though i've never watched a jurassic world movie, A strong 9/10 from me."
This movie was fun to watch.
"Jurassic world dominion should have Indominus rex ( may be black one or new one and this time fully grown ). If only they have told that a secret dinosaurs is kept hidden to buld the suspence. Rexy fighting and defeting Spinosaurus and Mosaurus attacking Spinosaurus in the first half of the movie as first half of the movie lack big dinosaurs fights. Gigantosaurus killing Therizinosaurus  at the start of secord half of the movie and towards the end killing more people. In the end Gigantosaurus defeating Rexy and Rexy ran away. Then out of desperation the clone girl press the button of secret dinosaurs and we have fully grown Indominus Rex attacking and eating main villan the rich guy and then attacking Gigantosaurus and Gigantosaurus ran away. Thus Indominus Rex claiming to be the real apex predator as it was told in the original Jurassic World that Indominus Rex is not fully grown. In the mean while remaning chracters ran away in a helicopter watching I Rex roar and less of Oven showing his hands to the dinosaurs. Instead of pet raptors we want to see wild raptors attacking and killing everyone and more horror element and deaths in the movie. This is a dinosaurs movie and it should be horror naturally. Everyone would have loved to see huge dinosaurs fighting against other huge dinosaurs, they missed a golden opportunity as this is the last movie in the Jurassic World series......"
"T-Rex: *screams*

❤😘
No Jurassic movie has come close to the first
Movie was in a nice way dumb. The end showed diversity and inclusion as if dinos learned to coexist with their prey hahahahahahaha so laughable. Everything woke turns to shit.

"First one was good movie, these sequels seem to go down to drain."
"im gonna have too sir thru this yall, my wife is a fan... God, this is gonna hurt."
1/10 movie lol waste of money
This movie was terrible!! the graphics bad the acting bad. I've liked them all but this one is so bad!! save your money watch it in a bit for free. Should be a shame for whoever put this out what a flop
I just want to know who made this movie. I’m very disappointed.
"I watched it 2 hours ago. Pretty good movie! But it's still not as good as the 1s before this. 
I'm not disappointed just confused because  this is the last movie and I was expecting an amazing movie for a grande finale. But I loved the movie very much!"
Yawn !
"They should've retitled it  ""The Jurassic Gremlins"" 😁"
Pretty annoying in theatres…. Every scene has like loud music lol literally
This movie was trash. Soo bad that ppl walked out or fell asleep. Even super high I found it terrible
"The movie is decent but cmon this is the last movie of the franchise and it's only that much, I'm expecting it would be better because it's very worldwide and bunch of new dinosaurs
But the final battle is definitely good one"
Wait what how?
"Oh it's bad. If you keep going to see it then they will keep making this lazy, unimaginative drivel. For this much money one might expect better than 6/10."

"Garbage movie., dont waste ur money n time"
I watched the movie with my girlfriend and we loved it but we were hoping that there was going to be more movies
"Incredible!! Amazing movie! the best I've see this whole year... the nostalgia and action had me at the edge of my seat! if only movie studios could keep making movies like this!! Yeah!! Top Gun -Maverick gets a 5 star from me!! 10/10!!!









Oh Yeah! and Jurassic World Dominion is a dino-turd of a movie.... some big ass insects destroying the world.... something, something.... corporate greed.... and there's dinosaurs running around... almost fell asleep."
"I watched this movie and very disappointed. its more like comedy style movie. If u like comedy and bit of action type movie, then this is a good one. this movie is not even close to the first one. Trailer shows totally different view compare to the real long movie."
When's Jurassic World Dominion Full Movie?
I'm watching this movie tonight
"I don't know, for me I stopped watching JP when the one movie came out where Guardian guy started to pet and train dinosaurs. They should have left them wild ""UNTOUCHABLE"" animals hell bent on eating everything and anything that moved like I'm sure they did in the past. 
Yup sadly for me anyways , once I say a trailer where he was petting a Raptor , that was the end of JP for me."
"4 anos mais mais o que???? 2023
Olha pessoal tenho um futuro para viver kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
I saw a couple of comments saying that the movie wasn't good. The main reason could be cause they're adults expecting a lot of action but I'm not in they're perspectives but I'll tell mine. The movie was a solid 8/10 when i went there weren't a lot of people possibly cause of the responses but they ended the movie with no cliffhanger but with just a good feeling inside it's just kinda sad it's the last movie but it's a good way to end the franchise I would recommend this for a younger audience but it's a little loud but  it's more for people who enjoy a lot of dinosaurs. My dad had said there was a lot of talking he's kinda right but they were made up with awesome scenes but i won't describe any because i don't want to spoil this masterpiece. Recommended for a young audience but if your really into dinosaurs or the whole franchise then i would recommend this. Thanks for reading! - A perspective from s younger audience
This is so fucking stupid
Watching it today
"Utterly predictable, tiresomely Hollywood."
Dinosaurs getting so well trained
Another film ruined by woke BS.
I’m telling you now this movie is bullshit no story no dinasaur just a waste
I wish they brought back the spinosaurus
"Typical new film to long, dragged on, the chase scenes where to fast and messy ! Plenty of cheese and some bad acting. Don’t take kids younger that 10 to the movies they will fall asleep 😁 imo"
That is one big pile of shit
this trailer is giving dawn planet of the apes 💀
De beste film
This trailer is better than the latest Dr Strange movie.
i just saw the movie and i have to say that BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD KILLED THIS MOVIE!!!!! SHE’S FUCKING AMAZING
Why the spino not in this movie
i have big expectation for this but ..... i think i prefer JW1 & JW2 ...
"Saw it last night, Amazing movie! ignore the stupid critics with crap media studies degree's haven't got a clue what they are on about!!!"
"I'll be surprised if even 90 percent of these bullshit comments aren't made by bots or some sort of paid workers churning them out.  so generic and fake sounding, ""I've been with this franchise since I was a kid and I'm so happy that the next generation can now... blah, blah, blah!"". fake!"
these fanfiction films really look impressive these days!
I remembered sequel said blue is the only one left.. and there were only just a few species dinosaurs in that basement.. others left to die on that island… now human beings is going to extinct and the world is going to end!? What? It does not make any sense….
i watched the 2015 one and fucking loved it. and watched this today and fucking loved it too!! geez all those scarejumps and all. 🫴🏻❤️❤️
Fake scene with small boy
something is coming
They absolutely destroyed this movie. Dont waste ur money
"Garbage 🗑 dinosaur victim identity and a diversity tick box in every scene 
Another nail in hollyweird coffin."
"Oh man, I don't know if I should go see this one, the secrets of dumbeldore or dc strange one first lol"
Who is still watching this trailer even after the movie is out.
Just watched the movie and damn am i sad that jurassic park is now finished. The movie itself is good. Imo it wasnt great great amazing wow movie but it was def a good woah movie.
"Worst movie in entire series ,,,

 over boring to d core ,, worst direction though u had old crew to make super hit ,,"
I enjoyed it but what does modified genetically locusts have to do with dinosaurs? why does the characters have layers of plot armor

Is this the last ever Jurassic ?
Why must there always be a sequel?
Got into a huge argument with my Dad over this invasive species sci fi apocalypse film. My Dad says we’d more than survive and that we’d just hunt all the dinosaurs down and kill them. But I disagree if you got millions of dinosaurs invading each continent and all the oceans are being filled with marine reptile dinosaurs that make sharks and crocodiles look like insects with teeth and humanity is blindsided by it all of it. and all humans have for protection is guns and explosives which are limited and have to be made. Humans don’t have any natural abilities or defenses to even fight off animals that are alive right now unless we have guns and explosives. So there’s NO WAY we could survive this kind of apocalypse. Plus it would be like a zombie apocalypse but with prehistoric animals where every man for himself and we don’t unite and organize to fight the apocalyptic problem.

Copper!!
I saw it the movie it was good and ok
Can't keep CALM
It was a rather disappointing end. It definitely had some good elements but it’s always the same in the movies. Humans think they can out smart 65 million years if genetics by controlling it and it will never be controlled. But I did over all enjoy it. Go see it. Might not make sense but I like the Dino’s. They also got soft on people being eaten on screen. I mean it used to be bloody and right there now all the deaths happen off screen and it sucks and it’s just lazy and down right PG. I want to see more of that.
This movie was really good 👍 👍
"I saw this on the day it came out. It was damn good, fuck what other people think"
Loved every movie except this one. This is the worst of all the Jurassic movies. The best of the movie was the trailer. Literally every movie in the theater is better than this garbage.
"3 months ago i've told you folks this movie gonna be shit. I was called a hater. It turned out to be shit. I guess i'm hater... that's right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Lesson from the story: stop throwing your money at low effort cashgrabs."
Saw it in theatre tonight and this movie blows. I literally didn’t know what the story was about and found it boring. I was expecting it to be like the other films but this one sucked

https://youtu.be/0xlPZa0OuFY        MY ART WORK FOR THE MOVIE !!!!
Movieweb has confirmed that an extended version of Jurassic World 3: Dominion will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc.
Just seen it. Was terrible. The cgi is obviously great but the dialogue and plot was HORRIBLE.
Went to watch this in the theater today and it was over an hour in when suddenly the power went out at that cave scene. It was storming outside and there was a loud BOOM then everything went black. We all thought it was part of the movie til we realized it wasn’t coming back on. Long story short they told everyone to leave and we got a coupon for a free movie so I still have no idea how it ends. Worst movie theater experience of my life because some guy also puked behind us and a couple were making out in the chair next to me and I was reminded why I never go to the theaters anymore.
This movie was a lot better than I expected it to be. Especially because the second one sucked
Movie became mission impossible. I did not like the movie.
00:58
This is sick
Love the old cast coming back BUT I really would love to see Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello all grown up some 30 years later.
Must ho faster!!
I haven't watched the movie yet but I read it quite a few comments and I see most people is not surprised by this movie. If they're going to go out with a big bang if this is going to be the last franchise of the Jurassic Park series they should have had a more better storyline even though I haven't watched the movie yet looking at the trailer it gives it away a little bit. And even though this movie was released today that only got 30% on rotten tomatoes and that is really really bad. But at the same time even though it got that percentage we can always look back from the original Jurassic Park movie nothing will replace the original film. And I'm surprised Steven Spielberg said it was okay for other directors to make more franchise movies of the Jurassic world. His baby his precious movie is ET and I'm glad that he stuck with the original and didn't make a remake of it because it will definitely ruin it.
I’ve just been to watch this in cinemas imax screen.My favourite Jurassic world and Jurassic park movie
I’m going to see this movie in an hour
2:25 For a seconds i thought that was a dead dog or cat Blue’s offspring was sniffing but i realized it was actually a dead fox.
"I loved the moment when  mobius cameo in post credit scene when he said ,""it morbing time"" and morbed over dinosaurs. What a movie, definitely a movie."
What are these things? Not scientifically accurate dinosaurs
Burn in hell...
"Very disappointed ☹️ 
Blue didn’t even get 5 minutes of screen time"
"What utter shit this movie turned out to be. Not a story in sight. Absence of any science, it doesn't make a lick of sense."
"Came back here to gloat about how much I was right about this movie failing. 🤷

I'm satisfied. 🤣🤣🤣"
"Just went back from watched the movie, IT WAS AMAZING!! Honestly it was well served, entertaining, and loved the old cast back to the movie. Love it"

https://youtu.be/vuCvyDQ5MqE"
I loved WWE watched it 2
Someone tell me is it worth watching
amazinggg moviee must watch
I couldn’t stop crying. This was the most beautiful rap up to a story that made my childhood. I’ve been obsessed with these movies since I was a little kid. These movies will always be apart of me. If I could just hug the whole team I would.
Just saw this and the scene at 1:05 isn’t in the film.
Why they removed this T-Rex scene 1:04 in the theater 🙄
"words can't describe my excitement when i saw alan, ellie, and malcom back"
Absolute garbage. I’d rather watch two LGBTQ+-$? People talk about how great Biden is doing.
Can Whitby Hertford be in the next movie 🦕 🦖 🥤 🍿 🎥
SPOILER: All the dinosaurs get COVID-19.
"Don’t waste your money people
It’s absolute trash"
1:05 when was this ?
Nice
thumbs up emoji x8
I saw the movie and omg I seriously did not like it. They made the people be badass but it was too much. The only thing I like was the appearance of dinosaurs blue and the female protagonist cuz she is sooooo pretty.
I didn't enjoy this movie very much. The narrative was all over the place. And I hated that teenage girl. She has a terrible attitude.
Just saw this movie.....beyond terrible. Worst movie I have ever seen
"If hard times made strong men, this could might be our sink or swim moment in our history. For one, I encourage this. It would kick in gear our REAL cooperation."
Jesus saves!
this is a good movie i watched it today it is GOOD TO SEE OLD CAST
It's sad how dumb new movies are.
Looks really dumb.
"These little sons of scheißes,  they didn't make the logo the Brachiosaurus that got left behind in fallen world"
This moive was so good!
United States of America 🇺🇸 Sponsored!
Nice
The old cast should of been in the first Jurassic world
see about 3 times really good movie
Going to see this tonight!
So proud this was partially film in my country Malta 🥰🥰. Going to watch it 3D tonight :)
"A very diverse movie. There are more african actors than white actors. I think the message has finally sunk into racist Hollywood that everyone is equal. I wish that the african actors were on the same pay grade as the white actors though. Finally, a family friendly racially diverse movie that all people can enjoy and see their diversity in action. Well done. I hope this trend will continue in the future. Great movie too."
Tuyệt quá
Sick
long neck dinosaur voice so amazing
This movie sucks ass. CG is so so bad. I feel like I was tricked into this movie by fake reviews.
"Holy Shiiii!!!!   

Looks amazing"
It's better than jurassic park... Haha #stop_hating_JWD
"They made this trailer so good, so disappointing it didn’t hit the spot 😭"
"Everything good about the movie is in the trailer, hey movie producer and sponsor If you wanna entertain people you must make DINOSAURS shot mainly, somehow close to the prev 2 movies, yet they don't listen to what people want, and go straight to locust and Jurassic casting, DINOS? "" We shot you, 1min off you go! ""the only intriguing dino shots were the raptors chasing Chris pratt, But that's just copy & paste from Bourne 
Finally the GIGA vs T-REX takes only about 5 min less. And That's the people claiming ""it was good ""all about. The movie wanna containing everything they want and they shifted the main conflict from Dinos into LOCUST. DINOS crawling all around the world you guys give a dam about it and say locust is human's main enemy? It's like people all in danger of flu But you say let kill cockroaches which doesn't matter to the flu?

What world we are watching?Carboniferous or Jurassic?"
"I really wanted to like the movie, but it was so underwhelming :("
Oooo
Guys do jot watch this movie is literall garbage. This movie is an insult to the previous jurassic worlds series.
absolutely stupid. no words
I’m so happy that I shielded my eyes from this trailer for months! I didn’t want a single spoiler. Pretty much all the scenes shown here were brand new and fresh to me - I had to make this experience special! The ending to my all time favorite movie series and raised as a child seeing it. Thank you so much for bringing back the whole cast! I absolutely could NOT wait to see Dr. Grant again!!!! 😭😍
Movie was ass! They made it all wrong smh they might as well kept them two story lines seperate
Watched. Really nice. To me its the best among the 3
Ong when they were wakin around with the lil Dino’s in ther cages 🤣🤣🤣 their mf toys no lie 😭😭😭 omm they only had one or two commands 😂😂 me and my girl were high asf and couldnt take it anymore and left laughing feeling like we just time traveled to a 80 alien monster movie maybe like gremlins is it kinda level of quality certain parts😭😂😂😂
Baby blue is now god bet
I loved it! It's really good when there are no boomers/critics yelling otherwise
"The story was pretty weak but the movie itself was enjoyable, even if it was a tad predictable, it still had it’s moments. I’d recommend it. I"
what are they trying to due wake up Godzilla??
plz do number4 Jurassic world
"Bigger, why do they always have to be bigger?"
Chris Pratt's been watching too much How to Train Your Dragon.
Sam Neill looks like he could play a old joel from the last of us
I actually laughed out loud during some of the ridiculous parts.  Unfortunately saw this after Top Gun.  Big let down.
"i know this movie is getting a lot of crap, but i really liked it! it was insane and so full of action, suspense, and awesome moments. i will agree that the story left a little to be desired, but i had a great time watching it and i know at least a few other people did."
"disappointed!
I was really excited to watch it because I liked 1 2 but this one not good!"
I saw and it was so good
BAAAAAAD MOVIEEEE WERYYYYY BAD POOOOR!REXY 5 MIN GIGA 5 MIN WERYYYYYYY BAAAAAAAAD
This movie makes Jurrasic Park 3 masterpiece
Heard this one sucks
This is 2hr movie only to see 4 dinosours ...... kinda dissapointing and im a huge fan but not of this one
the only thing missing is exploding dinosaurs
I. Am watching it tomorrow
"Chris pratt when he is in the airplane , he would be remembering about guardian of the galaxy"
"I don't care what the critics say. I love seeing the cast, especially Sam Neill (handsome at 70+). And the Therizinosaurus (the long-clawed dino) is quite cute and terrifying lol."
I'd like to point out that the Giganotosaurus is not the largest carnivorous dinosaur but actually the spinosaurus. It's even in the guiness world records as such.
"Honestly dont know what the haters are on about, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. The backstory Lacks a little bit, however it shows Humans adapting to the dinosaurs, and personally provided a much better ending to the series then just seeing everybody kill off Dinos. If all you want to see in movies is lots of shooting and guns, may as well go see a war film. Jurassic park is about How Humanity Adapts, not about killing them all off."
I will watch it only for the old cast
SO BAD AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Aku sudah nonton ini dan ini sungguh menakjupkan.
Like a 10yr old wrote the story
2 hours of my life wasted thats how baaad it was 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
The dinos in the 1st one looked better than these ones. Cheap.
I saw this movie worst Jurassic ever. The 1st and 2nd one were the only good ones
"Just finished watching this film, it's quite good if you're a casual viewer!"
this movie sucked more than a brazzers deepthroat special.
SLAY
I LOVE JURASSIC WORLD/PARK
Amazing
indonesia
"No matter what bad critics for this episode, i still love Jurassic World anyway. ❤❤❤"
It's really sad that this would be the last Jurassic movie. Thanks to the makes for such wonderful movies. Do watch this for a summary of all movies. https://youtu.be/4oesF-CJHbA
"Can't wait to see this!  Nice to see the original cast in this, too!  I just wish Richard Attenborough could have been in it. 😞 Been a fan if Jurassic Park movies since, well, Jurassic Park! 🦕🦖"
"The movie is atrocious. The whole Jurassic World modern trilogy went from 'ok-ish' to bad to worse. I'm telling you right now, I'm trying to spare you wasting money watching senseless drivel that can only be explained by the obvious: this is a blatant cash-grab. This trailer is fantastic, as in, fantastically deceptive. The impression you get of what the film will be from this trailer, is totally miles, galaxies away from what the ACTUAL film is. This isn't really a movie about dinosaurs, it's a movie that is set in a world where dinosaurs just happen to exist. If you want to see dinosaur films, honestly just watch the first Jurassic Park - none of the other films, even in the original trilogy, even come close. If you absolutely must watch multiple films, stick to the original trilogy. The Jurassic World trilogy is pure Hollywood nonsense."
"I actually liked it. Dinosaur cgi was good, not the best, but I loved the storyline and cinematography. Also like the personalisation and some scenes especially at the very end we’re breathtaking"
Top fail moevie shame
"In a couple hours I'll see this at the cinema, after binging the whole series for the last 48 hours or so. RIP Richard Attenborough/John Hammond, hope you're smiling form above at what a terrific concept of a franchise you've given us."
Fantastic movie 😎
Peaceful coexistence
I watched this in the theaters and it was amazing!!
05-Oct
"If they got rid of those biosyn boring scenes, and the locusts plot, and added more dinosaurs, and more moving jurassic park music (from 1993 movie), then I would have rated it 5 stars. 
Extremely disappointed, and that's coming from a massive fan of the franchise"
Terrible terrible Jurassic movie!. It’s woeful. It’s teeters on the border of being utter shiite but just manages to hang on. That said i did enjoy it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
"I don't know why people are disliking the movie? I mean I really loved watching the movie. Seriously!
I think if you'll watch it as a critic then you'll surely gonna hate as you'll pick only negative things. But if you try watching it as a fan then you are surely gonna enjoy it 
People are saying it's boring it has more story than action sequences and dinosaurs but every movie needs a story dude! You just cannot make a whole movie without any story with just vfx action scene etc..
I really enjoyed watching the movie and I request you all to plead ego and watch it as a fan 'cause it's a conclusion!! Please support it."
Boringgg same plot always
"The addition Of Jeff, Sam, and Laura just perfects this movie"
Worst film ive ever seen
this trailer and the fallen kingdom one is just ian speaking in the background for some scenes
Movie was good and old characters remember me when I was child and thay were playing young roles ❤️😊
I have already watch this movie yesterday
the movie was amazing
TOTAL CRAP. WHAT A WASTE. THEY COULD HAVE USED THAT MONEY TO FEED THE HOMELESS IN AMERICA.  WHAT A SHAME.
Alright yeah I just got back from watching the movie and wow it was a good movie my friend that went with me there so she really enjoyed it she said she really wasn't intimate 1st but damn she's enjoyed this one and now she's in to it now there was only 8 people counting me and my friend that I actually want to go see that movie I don't know if it's maybe because it was too hot it was at least a 100ﾟ today where I'm at maybe it was too hot for a week to come out or maybe somebody wanted to saw it last week but it is definitely worth watching It was nice to see the old cast I can't think of her name there but you've seen her in the commercials the black woman I thought I thought uh express It's not that X wrestler WEX wrestler a ex wrestler AEW wrestler she was ember moon with WWE she goes by a different name now I can't Athena with AEWI thought she would have been perfect for the role in the movie all this movie had a lot of action a lot of lots of dinosaurs are introduced to bunch of brand new ones that I have never seen or heard of before so it was exciting to see some new dinosaurs see the old cast back with some new what's the new cast and I'm waiting possibly to see if there's gonna be another one I mean you never know by the way they left it off it could be a sequel and it could be the end of the franchise I'm hoping myself that it is not the end of the franchise but there is gonna be another one I love the series I've never had Never seen anything wrong with any of the series I think it's a great great movie series I enjoyed every time I see them and I give it a 13 out of 13 skulls it's highly recommended to go see this movie if you like the 1st one or any album then you'll enjoy this 1 it's sort of like pieces of a puzzle here you want to know like what happened after the end of the you know when the last movie started you wanna know what happened to everybody and this 1 answers all the questions of what happened and now you wanna know what happens next after this 1 And I hope they continue making the series Is 13 out of 13 skulls the highest reading I give
It's a shame that a film like this with such great potential was wasted on a horrible plot
Felt like getting a refund after watching this movie in the theater
Stupid ass movie boring as fuck
Loved how the 2 story lines became one.  Needed more Chris Pratt.
Dna 🧬
"Sadly, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Bad acting, bad storyline, bad CGI,  slow, boring, campy, and predictable.   The makers of this movie think audiences are dumb and therefore will accept crap simply because of the Jurassic Park name."
Was not impressed.  Give it a 6 out of 10.
So do it with Sergey Brin only.
I watched the movie yesterday. SUCH A GREAT MOVIE!! THE OLD CAST DID AN AMAZING JOB!!
"Why does this have to be the last 😭
1:10 😭👌
2:15 😦
2:29 Burst Assault Rifle
2:35 Most iconic line"
"This movie had no soul, horrible actors, diversity bull sh#t, international cringe, no context, boring as hell, repetitive events, weird cuts and barely any dinosaurs. I really couldn't understand why they made this movie i was so angry to waste my money for 3 boring cringe hours."
"If you decide to see this at AMC theaters, there is 27 minutes of Ads and Trailers prior to film.  So wait until the last second to go inside to avoid that loud obnoxious nonsense that will make you want a refund before the film begins.    I enjoyed the previous Jurassic Park films,  not this one!  It is pretty terrible except for a handful of scares.  Instead of being 2hr and 30minute, they could have easily chopped it down to 1hour 50.    Wait til it is on streaming or you will fall asleep in theater"
Pretty boring and too long
"""the Jurassic era""  --- ah crap.....so we will have Cretacius Circus next
How can the effects look worse that JP?????   Oh joy...kids"
When the trailer is better than the actual film.
"This trailer just highlighted the good parts. The movie wasn’t as good as I thought it would be, and it was kind of disappointing. Sometimes it was boring, but I don’t think the movie was bad. There was no need for the locusts and the bad guys, though. Jurassic world dominion doesn’t really deserve all the hate it gets, because although it’s understandable, it still didn’t suck."
"alan , finally ❤🔥😍😍"
"This movie is the WORST of the franchise. Bad quality happens when the producers want to squeeze the cow. This film is an empty-headed special-effects monstrosity that's just as incoherent, offensive, and stupid as Dr. Strange and Multiverse of Madness."
"how about dont fly helicopters slightly above ground in reaching distance of a dinosaur or giant ape and use flamethrower-tanks and gatling guns instead of knifes and electro shockers, mr. goldblum"
"the only good thing in his movie is get to see dinosaurs and our this era animal walk together, maisee and her temperament, the baby blue raptor, the locust, the new biggest dinosaur, the some chasing on the road"
"it was so bored i farted 3 times, and my fart sound was heard cause the movie was not loud enough but luckily thereafter my fart has no sound but stronger smell, then after a while, a quiet scene again, my bro sat next to me fart even louder, bet the one sitting nearby wasnt that embarassed"
Trop de bruit … pas d’histoire
I left mid way. The movie is boring and lack storyline. I guess they ran out of ideas and just threw a bunch of scenes which made absolutely no sense. I mean how do you survive from a plane crash? How do you swim under the ice sheet and 10 seconds later the character is completely dried?
is this streaming anywhere that i can buy/rent? other than theaters
"What a waste of money. I am so sorry to say this as a huge fan of the franchise. First one was excellent, second mah, ok i gues, but this absolutely terrible. Like I said - waste of money."
Still remember the day I was attacked by compies😢
🗑️
Man the movie was not so good it's so sad to say this
Ah Daddy Steck ihn rein
1:57 spring trap reference 😨😨
"I just finished watching the full movie now. This movie is amazing. I'm waiting for part 4. I was able to purchase the movie online because I wanted to watch it full. The full movie was just release on 10th of this month. I just loved the video. If you want to watch the full movie, just let me know, I will send you the download link for free since I have already watched it.. but this movie is amazing.."
The funny part is in 35 years we will laugh at how wrong we were in the way the dinosaurs are depicted.
This movie is about engineered bugs and hardly about dinosaurs. 2/10
Was worth watching the Movie
I wanna dino movies every summer TAT
This movie was brought to you by biontech and pfizer
The first half was a mission impossible movie and the second half proved they failed their misssion
"My favorite part of watching jurassic Park. Was watching the movie with my ex and nephew. One of the last movie we watched before my nephew died  

We were giving the dinosaurs lines. We had the audience laughing. Too bad employees told us to stop lol"
Shame the spinosaurous wasn’t in the movie 👎
the music in this trailer gave me chills especially Hammond's narration but the movie itself was wack :(
"In every movie they always seem to make it out just in time, but I think their all doomed this time."
Sure CGI could be better but seeing all those actors together... is something special ya gotta admit.
"honestly, this movie was ok, it wasnt how I pictured it, but there was some moments of the movie i actually enjoyed, and a few easter eggs people will date back to the old trilogy. Granted it was suppose to be the last movie of this franchise, they really should've done better on the writing."
"""Dodgson!!! We got Dodgson over here!!!"""
I have seen the whole thing at the movies I love it so much that I am look at it again
Whoever edited this movie is either high on drugs or never edited a movie before
This is the best. Can't wait to watch with my kids
"When Tom cruise's films are better than Jurassic you know there's a problem.
Please get a decent director."
Im in love with all Jurassic Park movies ❤
Hollywood's really trying to scrape the barrel of old good films.
Just seen this movie. Not gonna lie. It's garbage
Next Jurassic moon ffs dinosaurs in space plz just end the series kill everyone off eat them all end this should have ended after 2 lol or not been made in between thr last 3 shouldn't have exist lol then maybe we might have a coherent story but now we're trying to retcon/reboot n smash the 2 together n force it to fit forcing things..Hollywood hasn't learned how to not force things on the ppl who don't want it never learned to take the hint! Ffs from Weinstein to be the only scapegoat for that it's still going on lol is it why everything sucks now too?
"""We made a terrible mistake"" yeah why can't we just leave things in the past that belong there lol it wasn't really the story telling that made it a box office hit as it was the times and the new tech in movie magic and the way cgi was used in film and that's not so much a big deal these days where its over saturated with such things"
Colin Trevorrow is a hell of a scammer. What a blow to the original trilogy and fan base in my opinion
I was watchng Jurassic Park franchise since i was a five years old  and I can't wait  rhe next movie to get even more likee
Awsmmmm
"Saw it today and there is one scene, that made the whole movie worth it. I'd call it the ""crawling""-scene if you know what I mean. The buildup was so perfect and I wished the whole movie was like that honestly x)
The story is completely bananas and every character has 100 layers of plot armor, but the cinematic experience is quite good. It's a spectacle."
Back to this masterpiece for the 100th time love Jurassic since young - Jun 2022
"It was nice that they brought back some of the original cast however that doesn't quite compensate for the fact that the cgi was overkill, there was hardly a plot & the dinosaurs felt more like side characters instead of the main focus of the film"
"I saw this movie last night and it was not upto my expectations.....There was no such suspense scenes like the other Jurrasic park movies and the ending was just a big disappointment.

I also think that they have repeated some scenes from the past and it was boring in the starting as well

There was some brilliant scenes in the movie but the storyline was weak which made it average."
Worst movie ever
Want to see final battle jurrasic world dominion https://youtu.be/jOi9aWtCJJk
i really like this movie
"DINOSAURS? What are we, in the seconds grade?"
I hope they make a scary movie next time... tired of the guy taming the dinosaurs... seems too unreal. Just make a horror show with dinosaurs.. too kid friendly.
"Saw the movie, wasn't impressed honestly. Although having the Jurassic park characters being involved was very nice, but It is basically a dinosaur movie focused on engineered bugs."
👎👎👎
Watching it now not bad 👍
"Jurrasic World Fallen Kingdom Trailer: **shows everything**
**people complain**
Jurrasic World Dominion Trailer:
**shows enough without spoiling the plot**
**people complain about it being misleading**
People REALLY like to complain lmao. Thought this was a really good film."
Am I the only one who thinks this movie was a giant piece of dinosaur crap 💩
"I always loved Jurassic movies with there natural simple forests scene's so for me this movie doesn't gave me that excitement or thrill I am searching, which found in Jurassic park and other series"
Such a stupid movie Dinosaurs running around earth eating people all of these movies are the same blue has a kid and just hang out in the woods so stupid
Super excited to see some of the originals especially the main 4 lol  they will always be my favorite and make it really feel like when I was a kid.

JurassicWorld? We will get a little bit more
One of the worst films I’ve ever seen
It was a coo movie. Not like the last 2 Jurassic worlds. Solid 7/10
WORST JURASSIC WORLD
"Pathetic pathetic pathetic totally 💯% you'll get headache after watching this movie plz keep anti headache pill before watching the movie my God what is this garbage 😡😡 feeling very sad that the storyline is completely horrible better to watch some Narnia movies..guys plz I never said to anybody before but now listen to me don't watch the movie 🙏 just remember one thing trailer is way way 1000% better than movie bcz that's all they have in movie scenes.. they have spoiled the brand name Jurassic ,..im writing this bcz right now I'm angry headache feeling like to punch director 😠😠"
"Dont waste your money on this garbage. 2 1/2 hours of cringey pop culture references, awkward jokes and a confusing storyline"
When will it be uploaded to youtube movies?
"The trailer is better than the movie 🤣🤣🤣, aint gonna lie, they had all the ingredients to make this movie special, but nahh, just blend and money wasted on the writers. Dinosaurs looked really great tho."
Do not go watch this. It is terrible.
Gathering all characters from each movie is just insane am rly looking forward to watch this in full HD!
"Personally, my list goes something like this: 1. Jurassic World. Very great and terrifying chase sequences. Who doesn’t love that? 2. Jurassic Park 3. I know, I know, it’s the least popular one in the series, but I can’t help but love the spinossaur. It’s really cool and probably the most scary of all the Dinos in my opinion. 3. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. I think the indo raptor was very well made but they could have executed it better. What really gets me is the ending. After watching the ending of that movie I was… Words can’t describe how excited I was for the next movie. 4. Jurassic Park. It has many good moments with the T. rex, but overall I think it has too much stalling. Half of the movie is just pure talking, and not the dinosaurs I, and probably everyone else, wanted to see. Finally, in 5th place, Jurassic Park 2. I honestly don’t have any fond memories of this movie. It’s, in my opinion, the most boring and bland in the series. And that’s my list! I hope you enjoyed reading it. I will be ranking Jurassic World Dominion once I watch it (which is today!)"
"When dinosaurs return, I'm definitely gna find and tail Chris Pratt."
This was soooo terrible
Watch it on 3d.. technical side is amazing but they could hve a good story and script
Yeah it sucked
Thank god this franchise is ending so I don’t have to see Chris Pratt doing that stupid hand motion thing to calm dinosaurs down anymore
"Why in every new movies teenagers girls get increased in roles
Ist because they charge less ?
By 2025 .. no single adult male will be there"
"Oh boy, this movie could have been done a lot better"
"must say a little dissapointed with this film ,same old same old , guess its reached its potential ."
Came here from tiktok 🤣
Bruh
"Loved the movie regardless of what critics say! Gotta love the OG crew and new Dino’s, I would watch it again!!!"
Looks good
1:56 HEY OWEN STOLE WILLIAM AFTON PURPLE GUYS SIGNATURE LINE!
"Pff like humanity couldnt handle some rampaging dinosaurs 🤣 we have machine guns, tanks, drones, planes, helicopters and plenty other toys but yeeeeeaaah dinosaurs are a problem for sure xD"
Is this the most jurassiciest movie of all jurassic parks?
Yo why so many people say this sucks 😆
"Dinosaurs *don't prepare for climate change*
Dinosaurs *Goes extinct*
Humans _Resurrect them_
Dinosaurs: ""Aw sheet, here we go again."""
"I would watch this if it was any good at all, but it looks like the worst franchise ever, with even more badly done ""dinosaur whispering""."
Just been to see. I definitely enjoyed it however I did find the final fight scene - filmed at night - to be mostly too dark even for the cinema. Hopefully this will be rectified on the dvd. It would also be a great shame if this was to be the last Jurassic film. Cinema just isn't the same without Dino's!
So bad. I left halfway through the movie. So 🗑
"“We created an ecological disaster” yeah no shit, obvi Dino aren’t exposed to coexist with humans."
"Damn this was bad.. can't stand the dinosaur whisperer BS, it's just too ridiculous and unrealistic. Was a great fan of the first 2 movies, 3rd one was still okay but now it has become unwatchable, despite the return of the old cast. The creators should be ashamed for this garbage."
Actually the demise of humanity doesn't bother me!  Maybe we deserve that! Losing the dinosaurs forever is heartbreaking! God what a show!
this is the worst movie of Jurassic Park/world series😡
Is this the last jurassic movie or more jurassic movie coming out
"the giganotosaurus tries to kill them and fails, like the indominus and indoraptor. nice."
"This movie had very little suspense and felt like nonstop action sequences, which in turn made the action less impactful.  Not sure about the comedy. It was awkward at the theater when the captain of the airplane said she liked reheads too. Was she making a joke or was she serious? Nobody knows. The sequence with Goldblum describing the button location for the door was not necessary and didn't add anything to the movie. I liked the bit with the motorcycle knocking the dino out of the airplane, but have also seen that same action sequence in the Fast and Furious. The concept that dinosaurs and humans were coexisting peacefully was not believable."
I am disappointed in humanity for making this not certified fresh
"Ahh it was just ""ok""   Nothing GREAT"
"What a shame . They wasted the concept  that was set up a the end of Fallen Kingdom . We wanted a 'war' movie with humans, dinosaurs and other animals fighting for survival against each other in cities what we we got was the same human espionage potline that has been done to death in these Jurassic movies  with added mutant  Locusts  . The fact Locusts were more intergral to the story than the general dinosaur population  Whilst it was nice to see the old cast back it was a shame they were wasted by the story"
"I don't feel sorry for the ~7$ I paid at the cinema. I feel sorry Jeff Goldblum had to take part in this. I hope He was paid well. I have seen better movies from Bollywood. Dinosaurs and snow? WTF? No, no. The plot was haotic and nonsense. They did waste 185 000 000$ on this movie. I hope they will get it back. I better re-watch the first part Jurassic Park 1993. 2 stars out of 10, because I did have 2 beers while watching it. Was happy to finally get out of the cinema. Boring and cheap."
This movie sucked pretty bad. They should be ashamed

"next time just show hand to make reptor understand us🤣🤣,,all actor show hand went reptor come close🤦,,boring lol"
Asking BLM to stop looting is like asking gay people to stop grooming kids. Not gonna happen......
Movie was terrible. Can’t believe people clapped in the end. Should’ve left these movies alone
I actually  got to see this movie  june 10 when it hit theaters in Oklahoma  and all i can say is you really out did yourself  steven spealdberg  this movie  deserves a golden globe  and a grammy and another  movie because the ending was a jurassic sise  teaser  for what is to possibly to for shadow  and the t rex omg out of this world  2 thumbs up
Jurassic Park. That's the ONLY good movie with the word Jurassic in the title.
i really hope its not the end for this franchise 🥲

"Just saw the movie today;

1) CGI has its subpar moments 

2)main plot is somewhat weak, the two subplots redeem the story much more

3) they dropped the ball on the animatronics, BIG TIME, which was quite disappointing because it was sprinkled throughout the movie for the smaller dinosaurs. 

4) some of the acting from certain actors was not good, and it’s hard to tell whether it was the script or the acting itself, but something went wrong in several interactions (especially at the beginning of the movie) 

5) the way they introduced the OG cast could’ve been better/more nostalgic. Also, they mostly used the OG cast for the main plot, which is a shame because, again, the main plot is not the strong suit of the movie. 

*The best and most redeeming qualities of this movie is the action and the main cast in general. Overall, very entertaining at face value. If you just really love dinosaurs and enjoy a thrill-packed movie, you’ll like this movie overall. However, if you’re a movie buff and need good story, this movie was not it, and you will most likely not love it. 

6/10"
"*spoiler alert*













Now I see why they hid the therizinosauruses face, so that we wouldn't see that it's actually blind"
pubg
This movie is gave me terminal cancer
Ret crushmu nge rekomen nonton trailernya jadi sekarang kamu nonton ini :)
Can’t wait to watch this today in the afternoon
"Just saw this movie, it was good and could’ve been done much better. But all I gotta say is that Jurassic Park the game (2010) is a masterpiece compared to this movie. Overall I give it a 5-6/10"
This movie is good I seen it
bruh i already watched it it was cool plz watch plz bye
bruh i already watched it it was cool plz watch plz bye
"I haven't seen any of the Jurassic World films, but I really love all the shots of dinosaurs against the world's landscapes."
"5/10 IMDB
🤦👎"
Congrats on making a ton of money. Well deserved. More than 140 million dollars opening weekend domestically
This looks like another flop...
I’m so ready for this
"Honestly I just got back from it and I didn't watch the trailer before hand and I LOVED IT!!!!! The old cast was great, the new cast was great, and the chemistry of everyone put together was genius! I really appreciated it."
Lol
"But, Parasaurolophuses were tropical dinosaurs that lived in jungles near water...."
Same old same old with these movies.
Here I was thinking humans were at the top of the food chain….
worst movie i have ever seen lol. ruined my birthday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8U60830p5U&t=386s Flesh Wound Features Dominion Review and JP franchise show special
It’s a shame that this trailer is sooooo much better than the movie.
I cant wait to see this movie!!! 😀😀😀
"This shit movie , I would like to get the refund"
OMGGG I LOVE ITTT!!!😍😍😍🥰🥰
That movie Destroyed Me
It's not worth the price of admission. Buy the DVD or wait till it comes out on Prime or Netflix. Pretty disappointing movie to say the least.
Remake please!!!!!!!!
Wished the movie was better but it was still okay. It could’ve been bigger
Wtf is inspector Campbell doing here
There should be series about that shit damnnn
"Movie honestly wasn't that bad. Old cast saved it quite a bit and it had it's moments.
If people had to walk out on this movie, that's their own fault x,D"
And i mean this in the most constructive way possible but this movie was like a bad trip that just wouldn’t stop.
I don't care about others review. i was waiting for this movie since a year !!!
It was an OK movie ending was disappointing 😕 2 stars
"Honestly one of the most average films I’ve seen in a long time. Wasn’t awful, but wasn’t good. The plot made no sense though"
where is my Spinosaurus ?😅
That scene Horses with Dinosaurs 😢😢😢😢😢❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Wow ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this movie is total garbage nothing in it made any sense the only thing this movie made me want is the meteor to come down again and end the boredom this film was a waste of 2 hours of my life
So....we have to save the world from the Dinos WE released to the world? Logic. Fallen Kingdom made 0 sense for an ending and this makes it make LESS sense.
I watched the movie 🍿 🎥 at cinema it was great 👍
"WOW, Jurassic park turned into a fucking insect movie. How to ruin a franchise."
"Worst Jurrassic ever.  No Plot, Bad Plot, Tons of holes in the story.  No Big Dino Scene, I mean bare any dinos.   Where the fuck did the girl come form?  Why do even need the girl  for the story."
Its more about humans than dinos. Big predators like Trex and giga doesn't even get any screen time
Audience were leaving halfway in my theatre
I allready watch full movie on the movie hall
"🤢🤮Having suffocated with too much cringey dialogue as well as too much virtue signaling, Jurassic World: Dominion is an absolute train wreck!
The movie storyline was too predictable and also too self referential(meta), confusing, unfinished non-sequenced narrating, and demystifying the tension and connection to the audience with the lack of urgency of the above mentioned. The film overall began to explore but didn’t embellish on the whole Man and Dinosaur coexistence🦖🦕. 
Had the producers stuck with its original formula, the nostalgia we were all used to but would have still wanted to see, the cast being stuck on an island in the wilderness with prehistoric apex predators just trying to survive, Jurassic World: Dominion would have perhaps been more exciting. The film was an absolute snooze fest. 
3.5/10💤🛌"
Inspector Campbell here giving major rapist vibes for some reason.
"Laura Dern is washed up; her career died in the early 90s. She dated that trashy Billy Bob Thornton, but he dumped her for Jolie. After that she got knocked up (and divorced) by a ghetto thug."
"Maybe the movie went to slow or its Just not a great movie. I am a old school jurrasic park fan from the beginning and all thow love the full loop back to the old trio but, IT mist something, and i think the bugs are not in theme with the jurrasic feeling it felt  like a different movie chapter. Feels not finished And missing allot more."
This movie was such a let down...
"there is nothing special about this movie, it's just a basic movie. Kind of boring but if you just love to see dinosaurs it's definitely for you"
this is  nostalgic for me because i always use to watch jurassic world when i was 7 and i remembered watching this with my friend
Keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed.
D
"Terrible movie.  How many times are we going to get the same old ending fight where T Rex comes in to save the day?  They’ve done that 3-4 times now.  Anyways, don’t waste your time.  I fell asleep twice."
Strongly recommend going to cinema to watch this.How is a film.SO good.I am really moved to see doctor grant doctor sattler and doctor malcolm.They are my childhood memory.They show up in this film!Looking they become old seems like my childhood wents by.love this move love them!!!
"Movie is terrible🤢 we walked out and other did too,special affects were terrible and not to mention the dinosaurs, they did way better on the previous movies."
okay already watch the movie.. love it and most important 3 of old main characters of original film main actor/actress was on this movie too. will give 5/8 stars..blue had a baby call Beta adorable  and such an amazing .donno how to descript it but i will watch it again on  Tv/netflix i guess...
"I don't know why the recent iteration of Jurassic decided to cast Chris Pratt as its star, and not only that, but to cultivate and expand his on-screen role as dinosaur-whisperer. I like Pratt as a person, but he is goofy and lacks the seriousness that Sam Neill commanded in JP1. Chris would have been better served as a comedic sidekick, where he could embrace his goofiness instead of trying to hide it. 

But whoever wrote into the plot a dinosaur-whisperer with a telepathic connection with raptors and other wild beasts, has ruined these movies by humanizing gigantic reptiles to the extent that they're not even scary anymore. Chris Pratt riding around like a cowboy and touching the head of that parasaurolophus like he's stilling its soul is too silly to take seriously. I mean does anybody who wrote these movies have any experience with reptiles? They do not behave like mammals. 

Because of this movie's glaring defects there's no suspense or mystery to it except perhaps a simplistic ""I wonder what the huge bad dinosaur will be this time"". Sam's line ""Bigger? Why do they always have to go bigger?"" even acknowledges how bad the plot is, and they had to put that line in there because the movie plot would simply collapse if it refused to poke fun at its own deficiencies. 

This movie - like the last - has no appeal to me, and no amount nostalgia-inducing cameos of older Jurassic stars can make a bad movie good. These are lessons that could've been learned from Star Wars TROS, where there are too many errata to list."
Movie not worth it
Looks like a waste of millions of dollars and 2 hours
2022 and the dinosaurs still look fake as hell
Do dinosaur really make that sound? How I wonder
"Sorry everyone, but I have to be honest.
This movie was terrible.

Basically everything that happened made me say, ""Whaaaaa?"""
SUCKS
TRAAAAAAAAASSSSSHHHHHHH
Movie is horrible
Glad to see we’re gonna see the old Jurassic park gang in this film.
Epic conclusion was not at all epic.
"I'm going to see this big pile of shit in less than 1 hour. At least it's 2 for 1 Monday.
[ Update ] The dumbest script yet. It was indeed a big pile of"
So now dinosaurs can survive in polar environments?
I’ve already watched it and Right now it’s June 13
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!! literally 2 & a half hour movie that was barely about dinosaurs & barely showed any either. Relied on nostalgia from the original cast but it was corny as hell
🔥🦖👍
Reality of life
Hero side
"The trailer of Jurassic World: Dominion is 100 times better than the movie I think that this is the weakest part in the whole franchise. They took a lot of time in the first half to build up the story I really expected much more from this as this is the last part of the franchise and I thought it will be much more good than the orignal Jurassic Park, but sadly I was wrong some scenes were good and the CGI work was also good but the story was very confusing. Overall, the epic conclusion of the jurassic era was not that great.

Jurassic Park is a masterpiece 4/5
The Lost World: Jurassic Park was a great sequel 3.5/5
Jurassic Park III was good 3.5/5
Jurassic World was a great reboot 4/5
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was also good 3.5/5
Jurassic World: Dominion is fine, not that much good 3/5

If you are planning to watch Jurassic World: Dominion, watch Top Gun: Maverick an amazing masterpiece."
"My dad showed me Jurassic park the original movie when I was a little kid and I’ve bee obsessed with it since, my stepmom got me the movie adaptation of the book, and I watched the second and third with him when I was younger and my aunt (his older sister) brought me to Jurassic world in 2015 the day it came out on June 13th, and than she brought me on June 18th 2018 for Jurassic world two and today we are going for the third in 2022, this is 100% the most meaningful movie franchise throughout my life"
"Why would a quetzlcoatlus just idly flying, minding it's own business, want to attack a plane for no reason?"
BUT however I really appreciate this movie 🍿🎥 it makes my time not bored😑
Patti kunna movie 🥵
"Can’t wait to see the old cast! The wide range of dinosaurs is also great, too. This looks like one of the only good sequels, not like Star Wars. Most of the scenes remind me of the first World movie. The flying Dino’s attacking the plane, the T-Rex in a burning forest…it’s just great."
"https://youtu.be/XITKjSrq67k
Please. Report and action against coz is not explain only. Real reason movie not release these channel upload piracy movie clip upload"
"Better than the last 2, worst than the first 3. Was Nostalgic seeing the OG cast, cinematography is awesome and some action scenes were well done but I'll still probably not end up watching this again. I mean the dude used his hands and  choked the crap out of a dinosaur.. reminded me lots to when Homer chokes Bart.

Lacked all the suspense the OG first 2 gave us."
Can't wait to wait to see this 🔥🔥 Looks absolutely EPIC!
"this movie was garbage. holy crap man, i want my money back."
"After watching Dominion , i enjoyed this movie more , i will revisit Fall Kingdom next .. Jurassic world pretty good as it stacked up against Dominion 😂"
Thank you so much for killing off one of my favorite franchises.
This movie sucked so bad.
sussasic worm nominions
00:54
its awful
Why do they always have to go bigger lol
"I love how cute Claire and Owen are together. They hug and kiss every time they come together after being separated❤!

I also ling how they adopted Maisie. They loved her so much that they nearly died for her. If that isn't what a family is, then idk what it should look like 😍🥰🤗"
This movie good but weak not enough action like you barely got to see dinosaur and Trex wax weak
Was left kinda disappointed after watching this today :( but I know I'm still gonna watch it every time it comes on tv lol like I always do with every jurassic/predator/alien movie 🤣
*Is this really the last Jurassic World movie?* :(
I love this movie I don’t understand all the hate that’s been going on social media
"This movie is awful. The more sequels they keep making, the more I appreciate the first one."
"My opinion: saw it today, it was ok, it was good but F A R from Great."
i’m going to see it in 4 hours it’s looks so good!
"Yikes.  Comments are making me not want to see this.

* I hated the first movie.  After reading the book, the movie was straight trash.  So, if this movie is a throwback to that shite, I'll wait for the Amazon Prime release."
I watch this movie today and it was awful
I don't understand the movie but this is amazing I watch the movie
"Man I was hoping for this movie to take place in urban area’s, instead they went straight back to a freaking island. I’m glad this is the “conclusion”.


This movie is a solid 6/10. The other five movies are enjoyable for the most part although I’ve only ever watched Fallen Kingdom twice, but man was this movie boring, reusing tropes, relying heavily on nostalgia, bland characters and just plain boring with no plot whatsoever."
"Another ridiculous JP storyline:  humans will go ""extinct"" because of dinos?  Lol, I guess the woke Hollywood producers forgot that humans have invented something called the .50 BMG, specifically to take care of very big incoming threats...   🙄"
"This was an awesome movie! The storyline and character arcs went in a direction that I wasn't expecting which ended up being a good thing. The action scenes were intense and there were plenty of them. I liked how some of the scenes and easter eggs paid homage to the original Jurassic Park.  I think a lot of people who grew up watching the original Jurassic Park movies will really appreciate this one. It was so cool seeing the cast from both Jurassic Park and Jurassic World coming together for this epic climax. The new characters/cast members added a freshness to the series as well.  I know some people were disappointed with Fallen Kingdom, but I think most people will really like this one. If you're a fan of the Jurassic movies and/or monster movies, I highly recommend it!

I'm so glad I was able to avoid spoilers/trailers as I usually do for movies I already plan on seeing. I'm just seeing this for the first time and it spoiled some key scenes."
Jurassic world was the absolute  best of this franchise  watching these last two made me say what the hell just happened ugh 😩 I didn’t like the directions they went with the girl being genetically cloned from a original child  storyline nor did I like these dumb ass added locusts. Like this is supposed to be the dinosaurs on our world and tackling the conflicts and what course of action to take not the opposite
"The movie was not good in 3-D, and not exciting to watch."
Just saw....Wow...all those characters.  Cool.  But the movie...ughhh!!!
Who is still here after watching the movie? It was good in my opinion
Not gonna lie but this is one of those reasons why Korean movies are better than Hollywood these days
"This trailer lied to me, this movie is the same boring thing as the other, that formula worked fine in the first movie and is time to stop. This was bad, very very bad."
It's better than what I thought.
This movie so boring the old one even better
this movie made me think this movie was going to be great... but it was pretty boring
Best movie i have ever watched
"Horrible movie, complete disgrace to the trilogy"
Seen this love it in 3D. Can’t wayyo see it again on tv
Is nobody questioning how all these different species are in this movie but not the last one?
"whew, i'm grateful they didn't show the Penisaurus in this one.  too many youngins around."
"yep, i'm ready to saddle me up a T Rex,  grab a 6 pack of Coke, and ride 'er to Disney World.  lolzz..    Bollywood strikes again!"
I saw it last night I loved it.
This movie sucked really bad.  Very disappointing.
I watched this movie in the cinema yesterday
I'm in the threatres right now and it's almost done. This one sucked. Was falling asleep at times tbh
I liked this movie. It wasn’t bad in my opinion and it was very enjoyable and fun to watch. The action was incredible. And Bryce Dallas Howard and DeWanda Wise were my favourites in it (and of course the talented main 3 cast from the original) I give this movie a 7/10
"The movie wasn’t that bad. Kind of boring, weird plot, but not all that bad."
"I remember walking downstairs when I was 5 and seeing my parents watching the first Jurassic park movie, it was at the T-rex scene and I was TERRIFIED. Little did I know, a few years later I would be in love with the franchise, and have a booklet of dino cards."
"Jurassic park 7: endgame 
Cast: 
Sam Neil as dr Alan grant
Chris Pratt as Owen 
Laura dern as dr Ellie sattler 
Jeff goldblum as dr Ian Malcolm 
Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire 
Alessandro Nivola as billy
BD Wong as dr Henry Wu
Vince Vaughn as nick van Owen 
Julianne Moore as dr Sarah Harding 
Vanessa lee Chester as Kelly Curtis 
Joseph Mazzello as Tim Murphy 
Ariana richards as lex Murphy"
it was soooooooooooo good
The worst jurassic Park movie.. Seems the director of the franchise ran out of ideas. How is it possible that dinosaurs can coexist with humans. So illogical and ridiculous..
Overbloated franchise. Should’ve stayed in the past just like dinosaurs. I walked out. The main villain trash.
"Here after seeing the movie, & it was garbage"
@1:59 Is that a Malta reference?!!?
"The trailer makes it look so good and I'm going to see it in a few days but I just don't know if it's going to be a good movie as the rest of the films.
Because there are a lot of comments saying it's garbage."
so diepointet after all that hype
"I would say it’s the worst Jurassic Film, but that wasn’t a Jurassic film, more like an overly stuffed, poorly written spy thriller with a few dinosaurs near the end. the Battle of Big Rock and that Preview, which had nothing to do with the film, are immensely better. Do you think we’ll be seeing any dinosaurs in your dinosaur film? They didn’t show up for an hour and ten mins. And the trailer is misleading. Also the 3D was non-existent. This is definitely the end of the Jurassic films."
"Who knew Amazing Spiderman dad is a main villian lmao 😂  just watch it, it a good movie"
Sheeeesh has a lot of parallels to the covid pandemic thought. Big pharma ect.
"It looks amazing, can't wait to see it. I just hope this trailer isn't like some movies that end up to not be as good as the trailer 😂"
"Wife forced me to see this and as I expected, it is garbage."
This looks really good 👍🏻
i watched it a while a go great movie
"I know this movie is gonna suck and I friggen love JP, first ever movie I saw as a child so it’s close to my heart but man this looks so bad 😫 I’ll still watch it for the dinosaurs and the old cast …but I’m seeing comments everywhere about how this movie isn’t even about dinosaurs ?!?! 🤔☹️"
Went to see the movie saturday. Huge! Huge disappointment. Two and a half hours! Walked out after an hour... Unbearable
I just walked out of the theater today I can't believe they put the same actors from jurassic park in it! And the same actors from jurassic world this was the best movie I ever in the entire franchise I have a feeling that this movie might win an academy award including best picture someday 😍🥰🤩👌🤘👍👍👍👍💟🌟⭐🌟⭐⭐🌟⭐🏆
"Just watch the movie at theater, it’s all right for a hangover movie. It’s like a James Bond movie with some low budget cgi dinosaurs, and a useless villain… 

I would give it a 4/10, it’s Chris Pratt with some Dino’s… it should have been much more dinosaurs, and way cooler with them in a city environment. At some points the story felt like a Sharknadoo sequence 😂 In my opinion the cgi of the dinosaurs are way better in the first Jurassic Park movie."
I liked this film more better than the first two Jurassic World movies.
"Finished watching it ,it was alright not great but not as bad as people are saying"
"Owen : I always come back
Michael Afton: I should say that not you"
"This movie is dull... i had never stood up so fast since morbius (oof) in the theater... The whole movie is... convenient. Like everything just happened to be there so the main characters (which there are multiple main characters) can just exmachina out of the situation... Literally no conflict is longer than 5min, the whole ""don't run"" and literally running the next scene... 3/10 still better than bruce Willis movie"
I only just realised the age gap between Laura Dern and Sam Neill.
Lol  Jedi mind control
“Bigger. Why do they always have to go bigger?” Was pretty upset that line isn’t in the movie.
"So this trailer is a lie- just shows even they knew this would be a stinker. Just end this series already, you botched it bad"
"This movie was such a disappointment, don’t waste your time watching this . Just wanted to get up and leave 🥱🥱"
Super good movie i watched last night really. Gd.  Spevial effect super good
"Horrible News! I was excited about this new movie until I heard about the DeWanda Wise character being cast as bisexual. What is this media agenda about portraying Black Women as either bisexual or gay? Most Black women are heterosexual!!! We love men, and want to be wives and girlfriends to men!!!! There is this racist agenda to make Black women (girls) the least attractive to men (boys), while placing White women (girls) on the top of the list for men(boys). I'm not spending my money to see this movie and I'm going to tell everyone I know not to spend their money!!!!"
Looks to be horse shit
I saw this in the theaters on June 10
This trailer was a bait and switch
I'm Done Watching The Movie And It's Soo Amazing And Soo Freaking Cool!! I'm Soo Happy That The Old Characters Like The Jurassic Park And The Other Are Included Into This Movie It's Soo Nostalgic And The This Movie Literally Give Me A Heart Attack And Soo Many Intense Stuff Happening In There It's Was Pure Gold And They Are Some Jump scare In There That Make Screaming Inside But That's Doesn't Matter Anymore You Guys Have To Watch This Like Literally 👀
Even before the first film came out I predicted that bringing back dinosaurs was going to cause a lot of trouble!
In India people don't like this move there are very waste people for like English but I Wii like it very much
They should have stopped making these after the first one.
"W O R S T .... W O R S T ....W O R S T ... MOVIE EVER IN JURRASIC MOVIE SERIES...
GUYS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY IN THIS... P A T H E T I C .... MOVIE"
what im not understanding is how the dinosaurs are breeding when theyre all females..... huh?
this is an awful  brain dead movie- i just walked out after an hour- don't spend your hard earned money on this Hollywood nonsense -you have been warned
running an running who is the hero of HUMANITY ??? Another stupid remake
Can’t wait for this
This movie was great
Spoilers but my biggest complaint for this film was that there wasn’t gore and Also Dodgsons death was a little disappointing to me because even though I’m glad he got killed by the dilophosaurus since that was a call back to nedry I wanted Dodgsons death to basically be nedrys death from the book where he encounters a 10 ft tall dilophosaurus and has his intestines hang out of his stomach lifted into the air in the dilophosaurus mouth
Oh boy this is gonna be a good one I bet love to see that feather guy chasing Owen I think
"Went to this trailer to check the comments and kinda' surprised it's apparently getting hate? 😂
Just saw the movie and I really loved every second of it.
Action-packed, great characters, more and new dinosaurs, wonderful suspenseful scenes.. It was fun for me and it kept me on the edge of my seat.
Might also be due to the fact that I didn't really come in with huge expectations(didn't even know this is apparently the last Jurassic movie? Lol). Just went in wanting a good time 'cause it looked good in the trailers. And a good time I had 🥰✨

Yeah I understand some comments about the locust plot but it really wasn't such a huge thing for me. It connected to Maise and her story of finding her identity and also Beta being part of it and not just a new cute baby character addition for fun. It wasn't like a plot out of nowhere, for me anyway.

Love it or hate it, I'd recommend to yes, indeed, ignore the haters, watch the movie for yourself and try to have fun 😂🐱‍🐉
Come on, it's dinosaurs!! 🐱‍🐉🐱‍🐉🐱‍🐉"
Looks wack 🙄
Not good movie don't watch
Sad to see no indominus Rex back
Today morning already look this movie..👍👍👍
Tamil movies is better than hollywood films
Terrible experience!!! Garbage plot
Utter crap. Want my time and money back!
"Worst fn movie I saw this year walked out of the theater, movies these days are trash asf"
guys do you know jurassic world 3 is not last movie confirmed jurassic world 4 will release 2025/2026
Great movie
i love the series i really do ever since i was a kid and its great but i cant stop thinking that no government on the planet  would ever allow the Dinos to live its simply to dangerous
worst movie out of all the jurassic world movies. 3/10
1:58 is my favorite scene from the trailer
Watched the movie in theatre and loved every second of it
OK I'm going
"Terrible film, I think the good reviews are bots."
The lord knows how much I like jurassic Park but this one was really bad
"Lack of emotion, flat plot and story..."
Just got finished watching this film a while ago
THE BEST MOVIE EVER SO THRILLING
A Really bad movie
I watched this movie in a movie Theater you guys should watch it it’s really good
Literally nobody died in this movie. Maybe like 3 people if I remember correctly and they was just background characters. Least gory Jurassic park so far
The trailer made the film look good. And i didn't watch the trailer until after seeing the movie.
don’t waste ur time going to see this movie this ad is so misleading it’s genuinely not a good film at all don’t waste ur money wait a few weeks and watch it online for free
"I’m pretty sure Spielberg hated the story about these, but keeps it quiet"
Boring ass movie i fell asleep....That should tell you everything.
This series aged beautifully
most successful movies in my opinion
"Really bad- Way too long, too many characters, dumb plot. Just plain bad."
bad ending for the movie .. why therizinosaurus and giganotosaurus. I dissapointed when Giganotosaurus only died with claw of therizinosaurus 😢. But overall I think the cinematography is good. I am only dissapointed with the ending 🙃
"There’s a reason why Spielberg left after #2 which was a massive failure. There’s only so much you can do with dinosaurs. Real Jurassic Park fans do not claim any of the sequels. 1993 movie will always be a classic for its groundbreaking practical effects, beautiful cinematography, amazing acting and the iconic soundtrack. Top #5 Spielberg film of all-time."
Must watch!! What an amazing movie! A perfect conclusion to all the Jurassic movies till now. The cast are too good as always and the storyline rocks. I don’t know why some people are just trying to put it down but honestly me being a die hard fan of Jurassic movies can definitely say that this is a blockbuster ❤️ Must watch
Zach and gray also should have been casted
"Just watched it... there was some good nostalgic scenes, but overall the plot was irritating lol. 50% of the movie was about some fucking insects.... I guess once you've done like 6 of these movies you run out of original ideas. Still though, it's a must-see for people who grew up loving the franchise."
Saw the movie last night it's the best one yet
"Would you believe that this movie is actually about the original trio racing against the clock to save the world from bugs that are going to eat all our wheat?

I wish I was joking."
I wish we could just have one more. Realizing this is the last one it’s made me cry
"Dinner time if you know what the Rock is cooking. Listen, the cows are coming home. My ass is in the seat. I can't wait to see the adventures of the glass dick"
"Spoiler alert… I seen it today… and I’m not pleased with how it turned out.. the Dino fight scenes are short and horrid. And why was the new gigantosauras  trying to be their friend then unleashing hell on them like the indorex did.. the gay black chick was extremely annoying and her scenes were super cringe, also why every time the old crew got together they had to keep playing the Jurassic park theme song ? Idk I’m a huge JP/ JW fan and this one definitely let me down big time.."
It's all in ark survival
Everybody saying the movie was trash but honestly it wasn’t too me
the one
"Worst experience I had after watching this movie so many characters
Movie is below avarage taken for granted 
This is not accepted."
"if I find director of this movie, I will slap"
Movie sucked.....loved the old faces .... But it sucked ....more like a rescue movie then your topical Jurassic park...
We want Jurassic world 4
If the movie ticket wasn’t a gift I would have walked out
"This movie sucks and dribbles on for ages. Boring, monochromatic characters and one dimensional dinosaurs. Save your time and money"
Thank god I didn’t watch the trailer - spoiled so many things - I feel going in blind made my theatre experience so much better - really enjoyed the film!
This movie sucked jp3 is actually better
Very misleading trailer. The trailer implies dinosaurs are running around through the cities and the people have to save the world from the dinosaurs. In the movie it has very little to do with the dinosaurs and guess what they are trying to save the world from? Locusts. Modified locusts! Not dinosaurs. And the dinosaurs are under control. The movie wastes a lot of time on the human characters. Who watches a Jurassic movie for the people? We wanna see dinosaurs! I’d recommend waiting until you can rent this movie so that you can fast forward because it is boring. Some scenes are good but some aren’t.
This  makes me think when I was obsessed with dinosaurs a long time ago and I learned about all of them and there names and I loved going to the museums it was a very good movie 10/10
AHSGAHHAYAHSGSGGSYS ITS OHT I WANNA SEE AGAHAGGA
As a fan of the franchise this movie didn't do it for me like I thought it would. There was action but not enough and I learned one thing the T- Rex can't handle nothing by itself. Ole tag team behind 😂😂
Can't wait!!! This is going to be BIG!!!
Love the whole series and will definitely see this as well.  Nothing will ever touch JP 1 though including most movies period.
What a disappointment:(
My 2nd favorite Jurassic movie. My favorite favorite is the third JP
"Watched it last night & ngl, it was horrible... 🤦🏻"
"Critics made it sound like this was gonna be another “The Last Airbender”. Honestly, I enjoyed it. And this is coming from someone who disliked 2015 Jurassic World very much. Fallen Kingdom and Dominion were the better of the “Worlds”, despite its nonsensical plot at times. But the 1993 classic Jurassic Park will forever remain the king that never needed sequels."
yes
I love blue!
Save your money on this boring film. Watvh Top Gun is a thousand times better
"Saw it in the theatre today. After the movie ended, the guy that was sitting next to me simply said “ok”, shrugged, got up and left. Perfectly summarizes the impression this motion picture leaves on the viewer. Instead of a survival action movie with humans vs dinosaurs in cities, Universal gave us a movie about saving the planet from genetically modified locusts using genetically modified kids, whilst the dinosaurs are just “cool backdrops”. Nice. And I wanted to like this movie so badly (San Diego is my favorite sequence in Lost World and I had hoped Dominion would be something like this), but this trailer just lied about what the story is about."
I know what the Dino’s called nearly all I think
Wonderful acting done by dinosaurs with a little story 🙂🙃
i just got home it is the best movie that i got to watched the movie room was packed with a lot of people i love the whole movie
Movie was okay. The fight scene was short. Would not watch it again
Cant Wait to see the new dinosaur “fuckaroundandfindoutasaurious”
"Worst one yet.  That's saying something when I enjoyed JP3 better.  If you want spoilers I can offer some.   Save your money.  This one is just a last ditch cash grab at the franchise. 





The whole, ""Blue baby got kidnapped,"" thing they sell you on, it is barely touched on.  Movie is basically a throwback to the three main Originals.  Bunch of plot holes if you pay attention to what they say is on  the reserve and when they got there.   Clearly states only one T-Rex was caught and brought to it days before alan gets to reserve, end of movie there are at least 3-4 on it....how? It's been 4 years and not many dinosaurs survived the last two movies..how is there a huge black market and so many on it?  I mean, some these things don't add up."
I saw it today! Awesome! I'm going to go see it again while it's still in the theatre.
Movie is awfully written and there is no plot and slow developing. I walk out of theater. This is not worthy spending money on this movie
Movie is horrible and boring.
Quetzalcoatlus!
"""....we are subordinate to it (nature)""  Seriously though"
I just went to see this. It was actually good. Ignore the haters
Such a bad film l fall sleep while watching it
Honestly I hope the dinosaurs kick our asses. After the last movie they deserve revenge.
"How do you ruin a good film series? I’m sorry but the past Jurassic park movies have been fucking jokes. You should be ashamed of what movies you make. The series was fine with the first original movies. All of them were good. Now what you do is add all this random shit and fuck up a good title. This is so sad that you would even want to be a part of making these god awful movies. Please don’t make anymore every one keeps getting worse and worse. How do you fuck it up so badly it’s not that hard, just don’t spend money on a shitty movie and think that it’s good. Your rotten tomato review is a 31% do you think that’s good? What would your mother say if you got a 31% on a report card? Like you are all actually brain dead your company is a joke now."

Saw the movie today. Absolutely beautiful movie
One thing I'll say about the film is it's definitely better than Fallen Kingdom
I will be sad this is the last one
Dwinosore
Blues baby is so cute
Don't waste your money. It's crap.  Very poor ending the whole Jurassic franchise.
It sucks
30mins ago I was vitnessing an epic fight between 3 big Therapod 🤣👌🔥😂
Animation is mre mre over.... Jurassic park first is the best animation in this series
Good movie just watched it today
Loved being an extra in this film doing the lecture scene with Jeff Goldblum ill never forget it ! :-)
"This franchise is taking the same road as Fast and Furious. They're doing too much...

Soon it's gonna be dinosaurs and humans communicating together to fight aliens... 😒"
So cool Trailer
"...and behind this door, we have...wait for it...another dinosaur! Pretty much sums up the movie. A little too rich for my DNA (if you know what i mean) but overall a good entertaining production i am sure will never die out."
Super Awesome .. I really wana see this the old cast is back !
No good movie
I Like This Trailer ❤️💙💜
How’s the movie?
More than expected 😭
"ive literally just got out of the cinema after watching it and... I LOVED IT! i think its a brilliant end to the series, i would definitley recommend it. the action scenes are amazing."
This movie is shit. Saw it last night. Awful
I am so hyped for this movie although really sad to be the last one😢 . But it is nice seeung the old cast all back
Just fyi Lowe's is selling Jurassic Park T shirts if you want to wear them when you go to see this movie!
"Adrenaline boosting! Action packed! 1st cast vs 2nd cast mash up was amazing & did not disappoint! Music was awesome! Story line, plot were awesome! New cast was awesome as well! I laughed so hard at some points ticklish thrill was on point! Thank you for this! My husband & kids loved it as well!"
"I just watched the movies today.
It was awesome many new dino was there allosaurus erlikosaurus dimetrodon ,giant locust,giganotosaurus.
My favourite scene was the battle between the trex and the giganotosaurus"
I can imagine Owen and Alan having an argument about either Owen having Blue technically as a pet or who should be the leader
I love quetzalcoatlus
"As Goerge Harrison said about the B-Sharp's, 'It's been done.'"

Broo the dilophasuaresss
"This was easily the worst installment of the franchise, lacking the tension, the quality of acting, and Spielberg's deft direction which made the original Jurassic Park so good. What we’re left with is a chaotic storyline with a dead cast and subpar CGI’s. Really hope that this will finally put an end to the franchise so they can stop ruining our great classics. I feel bad for the original cast that was brought into this mess and I’m sure they felt that too after seeing it. This felt more like a mix of fast and furious and mission impossible than Jurassic Park (thanks Universal)"
I've seen the movie it was a great ending but don't have a closure. I think the last is not real.
Thought the movie was trying to show what its like to live with dinos. It was really only ok. Again it was about a park without visitors 😂 and the main villian insects. Wow....
"0:27 owowowowowowowwwwwwww
0:44 AGAIN MORE owowowowowowowoww"
nice
Watched this today. Thought they were going to go a whole different direction. Was ok but could have been great. Disappointing way to end to be honest. Reminds me of the scene in Bohemian Rhapsody where the producer says formula's work. Yep you guessed it just more of the same.
"Honestly it's the best of the new movies, it would've been pretty good without these 3 but they made it, great film"
People keep complaining about the story well they just gave us a great jam packed dino action film... Are you not entertained? 😎 Haha
I loved the movie so so so much. Owen Grady has always been my FAVOURITE ♥️♥️♥️ he looked so handsome in the movie…………i am screaming
"Just watched. Here is my opinion.

For a Jurassic movie, I hate to say this, but it's pretty bad :( 
It breaks my heart to see how much potential it had. Honestly, the main highlight for me was the Therizinosaurus intro scene. That's all. Also the Dilophosaurus scene, it's like the same iconic scene from '93 but not so iconic or outstanding here :'( 

Maybe give more screen time to the Dinosaurs? It's a Jurassic movie! Is that too much to ask? Why Hollywood? Why?"
"This movie ending in a nutshell :
T-Rex : Never thought I'd die fighting side by  side with a Therizinosaurus
Therizinosaurus : What about side by side with a friend?
T-Rex : Aye, I could do that."
പൊളിച്ചു
Just watched it and all I can say is ICONIC!👏🏽💯
Cool man
Roar
that is one big pile of shit
Movie is complete trash boring and long for no reason
"Mr. Trevorow, you just destroyed my and a lot of people's childhood by making these siquel shit films. Thank you. The worst director in 21th century"
Not worth the money…
This movie is a train wreck that has gone so far off track that it can't even be considered a Jurassic movie.
Wooooooooooooow fantastic
Omg this looks amazing
83K dislikes?.. Really? This movie was awesome. let me guess.. a bunch of snowflakes and soyboys upset because Chris Pratt loves God.. That's the modern left for you. They hate everything.
*This Movie Was Fking Trash 😂😂 The Trailer Has More Dinosaurs Then What The Damn Movie Had So GLAD I Didn’t Spend Money Watching This Garbage* 🤦🏻‍♂️
Next film will be the next monsterverse
i just watched this (almost) and i walked out after 1.5 hours cause it was so damn boring. i ended up playing in the arcade until the movie finished and my group came out; 1 of them fell asleep lol.
"Outstanding, incredible movie"
This is a terrible movie. Let this poor franchise die in peace.
"This movie is not that great :( 
I was expecting more out of this. The dinosaurs are not even the main theme anymore."
This is an example of trailer is way wayyy better than actual movie
Scene 1:05-1:06 isn't included the movie
"Watched it yesterday... actually this movie was not bad as written in reviews and all.. First of all i am a hell of a jurassic world fan!! But yeah it was not good as jurassic world 1 { 2015} and fallen kingdom... but far better than jurassic ""PARK"" 2 and 3... this is the final movie of the jurassic trilogy so could've been better.. but not bad actually.. was good.. my rating: 7/10."
I just watched. Please save your time and money. Honestly this is the most stupid movie I ever seen from a long time. Huge disappointment.
I hope this movie using the whistle ..like Jurassic park |||
We're glad to see these Movies and Sequels. It's golden era of Cinema.
Locusts….
I don’t think 1:05 - 1:06 was in the movie
"shit movie...thisbis jurrasic park movie...u can show just dinosours, fight between dinosours, fight with humans enough..this all we needed..but u did nothing?"
"I saw the movie today. Focking woke bullshyt agenda movie like Star Wars, Star Trek, James Bond and all of the woke movies of 2022. I hate Jurassic World... i will only watch my Jurassic Park 1 DVD and never give 1 dollar for Jurassic World merchandise."
"I can accept it , if they just said the trailer is the movie itself! , it's that awesome !"
Whoever is making these movie trailers needs to start making the movies. Bcuz boyyyy the difference is night and day🤦🏾🤦🏾🤣🤣 movies dont even compare
may be we have to watching prehistoric planet now you disappointed about jurassic world dominion you can watching  prehistoric planet now
Nice you made a movie more worse than fallen kingdom
Indians review : One of the average movie of Jurassic world series 😔😔😔
I hope it hits dvd this year because I won’t be able to go to a theatre.
Y’all somehow made a movie worse than Fallen Kingdom
Very bad movie...I hate this
"I just saw this today in Dolby, it is similar to Top Gun in that as a sequel it has amazing visuals and action, but the plot and acting are sub-par compared to the original. The plot and acting of this is by far the worst of all the Jurassic Park movies. A lot of goofy and silly lines mixed in that trivialized the movie. White actors portrayed as buffoons and idiots. (that is all i will say on that). I am super pro-animal rights and hate people and love animals for the most part. Still, way too much agenda, showing animals trapped in cages. It is disturbing to me who owns a cat and loves animals, and a ton of this movie is a statement for pro-animal rights. The only problem i have with that is like the Kong movies, I don't want to see agenda and get depressed seeing animals in cages, I JUST WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED AT THE MOVIES, NOT CONSTANT AGENDA. If this helps animal rights and PETA, i am all for it, but I want a fun, uplifting movie, not a familiar plot with animals in cages and then they escape at the end and get revenge. If you have seen the other Jurassic Park movies, this feels BY FAR less than a true genuine movie and feels very light-hearted and goofy. I would give it a 7.5/10 Amazing visuals and shots of dinosaurs including under water, but terrible acting overall, way longer than it needed to be"
Going to see it tomorrow in iMax theater!!
honestly a 6/10 movie
"looks promising ... having said that ..lol  the plane scene, the dinosaur expert asks ... is that a plane? ... then token chick flying the plane responds with sass ... not exactly ...you blink and now she is the expert.  interesting logic."
1:57 FNAF reference?
Trailer was better than the actual movie lmao
I can’t be the only person who observed that the movie would’ve made complete sense if you cut out all the dinosaurs. They just made a movie about bugs and clones with Jurassic Park characters then shoved in dinosaurs every other scene. The dinosaurs have no impact on the plot (except for the last scene). This movie honestly disappointed me
"Boring, bad storyline..."
"Pretty good t-rex gets to fight giga, blue comes back, and dinosaurs are here!"
See it in Dolby YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT ...felt like a Universal Studios attraction
I had high hopes that this movie would be good but I was disappointed :(
Saw it today...omfg..how it was able to be worse than the last film which was a shitshow is beyond me but it was
"I just got out of the theater. Jurassic World: Dominion was a blast from start to finish!!! The action was intense, the return of the cast from the original Jurassic Park made it nostalgic, and the final scene with the dinosaurs and animals coexisting was so visually stunning. Solid 10/10

1993-2022
""Life finds a way."""
Seeing it tomorrow hope it's good and hopefully it's even better in 3d
Just saw this worse one out of the whole franchise
"Well, I finally got to see Jurassic World Dominion and I quite enjoyed it myself."
If we dont call the baby raptor baby blue ill be mad
film ini agak bulet alurnya..jelek
"In Genesis chapter 19 verse 4 thur 15,  Gomorrah and Sodom was destroyed because of Homosexuality."
Literally an Ark movie.
Went and seen the first one as a kid in the theater and now i will see the last one
😡
Looks incredible
"I am watching Jurassic Park Red Carpet, I am 34 years young and comparing the Hollywood decades ago glamour to now, it's doesn't exist Now!"
0:54 cute
Wow this looks super amazing I haven’t saw anything like this since no way home and endgame
"The trailers always make it seem amazing...
I've seen too many letdowns to be excited anymore"
"If we comparing this one to the previous ones ,,, its the Worsttttttt between them 💔"
"Haven't seen the film yet but from what I read, the writers failed to capitalize on the ending of FK in the worst way possible
and Wu STILL IS NOT DEAD!"
This film was awful
"This film was so bad, i almost had a seizure. True story"
"OMG .... just watched it, get ready to move a lot  in your seat. I feel like this was one of the best."
Yo health ledger as Dino Joker was amazing bro
The CGI looks like a downgrade to its predecessors 😢
bro i saw this shit yesterday all i got to say is well done on a success ive loved this franchise since i was a kid and only got better over the years and this is a perfect finish for the franchise
"Great visuals, cinematography is class apart and awesome cast! Though slow paced and sound work taking back seat a little, nostalgic for sure and concept was a great!"
"Oh man this movie is bad.. long intro..feels boring and very slow.  Grasshoppers in a special room where  first clip a few hundred of them, 1 hour later their where 100.00’s of them on fire? And also Breaking bulletproof glass. 

How are grasshopper flying when their paper like wings are on fire? Forest on fire because of burning grasshoppers. 

Such a big place and in a few minutes all of the dinosaurs are called to home base and then? Walking in the garden of the home base very logical.. 

Project of billions of dollars and such a weak system and logical thinking feels very unrealistic and poor scripting, also everything looks very off few clips had a good build up.

I my English is not my main language. 

I loved these movies. This on is bad nothing els"
I guess Goldblum's last line was only for the trailer or a deleted scene. I actually looked for it when watching the movie. Good finale for the franchise
"These people love being chased by dinosaurs, they should stop hanging around them."
"Going to see it today, looking forward to it, and it sure looks like it won’t disappoint"
Its a Good movie
guys! Blue has a baby but NO mate because she has monitor lizard DNA which can get babies with no mate! That's why she has a baby of her own!
Amazing movie. Don't believe those stupid reviews. I just came out of the cinema. Wonderful.
omg this is SHIT
#stop_hating_JWD
This franchise has become the Godzilla and King Kong of our country. Complete garbage. Stop re-making and ruining the original movie. Did you all forget the last movie already? So bad.
טריילר מושלם יש לי את המשחק שלכם ואני עוקב בערוץ שלכם ביוטיוב ואני הולכת ליראות את הסרט הזה שבועה הבא
Dinosaurs are my favourite animals and they are special ❤🥺😔
Who's here after the release of Jurassic World: Dominion?
The film was horrible smh and I love the Jurassic franchise
刚看，我觉得不是特别新鲜吧，但已经很不错了，演员辛苦了❤️❤️❤️
"I so, SO badly want to see Allen react to the relationship that Blue and Owen share. A loving and respectful coexistence filled with genuine care and understanding.  I can't wait to see his face do the ""HolYfucKinSHITwhaaa?"""
Was not impressed sadly as per previous.
Is Nick Robinson in the movie ?
"Saw the film, wasn't that much good as i was expecting still enjoyed it... however i really was expecting the scene with the T Rex @ 1:04 which they didn't include in the film 😭😭😭😭"
You fricking stuck out your hand
Bro
"Thankfully the last part, too many dinos. Storyline very poor"
"Whatever dinosaurs can dish out, I am confident that Barrett can provide a solution ;-)"
do we know if we can buy this after today on youtube movies?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮Everybodys There!!!!!!!!!SCREEEEEEEEEEM😁
"Never seen so many people keep constantly checking their time on the phones just to walk out of the theatre before, and then there's this movie"
This movie sucked! Just saw it yesterday! Why does the CGI at the beginning look  90s video game bad.  Like Giant Grasshoppers are the villains !?! Lmaoooo who approved this!!! Also terrible acting by the wakanda forever girl! She has pretty eyes but how did she get cast? I appreciate the diversity tho! Also way to randomly insert some pre pubescent girl and make her a main character so the audience can relate ? Must be between ages 9-12 to enjoy movie lol
Cant wait to go watch it!
Worst movie ever was looking forward to it the dinos looked fake and animated rate the movie 2/10
Just skip this movie. Its really awful. Plot is weak. There a tim cook wannabe as bad guy. The reunion feels forced. And there’s not much dinosaur action in the movie. Even the giganotosaur scene are ridiculous. Easily the worst jurassic world series.
It so beautiful 🥺❤️
"Never thought I would be disappointed in a Jurassic film, never. I waited so pumped up since 2018 for it. Can't believe I'm even writing this, but this one was a 6/10 at best, that's seriously being generous.

Won't go into details but my main issue with it is that it was sold on the idea of dinosaurs living amongst the public but disappoints by giving you yet another Jurassic film with dinosaurs being confined to a single facility and feels like we're back on an island again.

I could have forgiven all that still IF they had given us a good dino film but they didn't even give you that, as there is a huge lack of dino and human contact or dino action in general. Not even was the T Rex present in this movie much! like literally 5mins of it!

The prologue, the 'Battle at Big Rock' and the open theater scene that was advertised online were all way better than this entire movie.

I honestly still want it to make good money just so we can possibly still get justice done to the idea of a truly open world Jurassic film.

Colin Trevorrow and the marketing team should be ashamed for over selling it as such."
Sad Animals😢
the movie was ass.
Save the money. Saw this and it was a stinker. In the end dinosaurs all live happily ever after? Hahahahaha.
"EDIT: I thought the movie was great. Forget I said anything.
















Great. A conclusion that we thought would be the best only to realize it’s total garbage."
gwerih dah nonton
worth watching it....i personally loved it. Actions in this movie are fucking incredible you're gonna just love it🖤
Padam vera lvl uhh vroooo💥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥
So exited
"Awesome movie! 100% the best of the series! Go watch it!
The critics hate action movies, so they will hate this too."
"No new movie can beat the first three, as nowadays movies are made to maximize profits not to be good movies"
"This movie sucked, basically was about original JP actors fighting a flaming bugs life of giant locust. All we wanted was to skip to the raptor chase and trex fight. Turned a 30min movie into 2hrs
Don’t waste your money at the theater. Wait a few months till it’s on Netflix if it’s a must"
"I typed in ""June 10th,"" in the Youtube Search Bar, and sorted the results by ""View Count"", and this was the top video, with 50,005,274 views as of 06/10/2022 at 8:52 A.M. Eastern Time(U.S. & Canada)."
"It is now an established fact that if you hold your hand up to a dinosaur's head in a calm and steady manner, they will bow and let you pet them (kinda like Buckbeak in Harry Potter), but only if you're Chris Pratt. SCIENCE AMIRITE!?"
I will watch this
Movie was trash 🗑
The trailer is so good.
the computer animation for dinios is amazing
Was waiting for this forever
I got my tickets for today at 3:20.
"Another attempt to showcase the fairy tale called Evolutionism.... and yes, before we forget, dinosaurs (reptiles) evolved into birds.... all you need is a 8k camera? and some clever software"
sh*t movie
I have already watched this movie 🎥 in PVR play house on my birthday 🎂
I’m a religious fan to Jurassic Park franchise but if they make another super super sad dinosaur/animal death scene in this new movie I’m going to have some problems. Haven’t been able to rewatch fallen kingdom I get it’s paying homage to the original movie but nope not for me. Leave the nice dinosaurs and animals alone please
booooorrrinnnnnggggggggg movie! lack of story!
Today is the day
"Watched it, couldn't wait for it to be over with. Trainwreck. Sexual orientation propaganda. Lousy script. Lousy bad guy. Oh brother. A real sleeper - I mean it puts you right out."
Imagine how much of a surprise it would be if Alan and Ellie were not in the trailer. I get why they were in the trailer but it’d have been amazing it it was a surprise
I saw it yesterday the movie is AWESOME but the story ...well a bit lame
We are asking Jurassic park not Jurassic city......🤦🤦🤦
I saw it yesterday and that was a damn banger i lot of ref from past movies i loved it.
"watch this movie in theatre - first day and first show...
 Boring writing and boring movie🤬🤬🤬 . I want my money back
Hate from India 🇮🇳"
Jurassic park 123 monster hit 🔥 Steven Spielberg direction brilliant ... Jurassic world also amazing like series ..Collin treverrow fantastic extraordinary direction...
Literally had no idea there was another Jurassic World movie until just today
"“When you order something on wish and get delivered disappointment this is a exactly happens here What they showed in the trailer is not what you’ll see in theatre 🎭, this JP Dumbinion sucks. Save time &$ 😢😢"
I just watched this in golden screen cinema(GSC) and it was great
Who are these critics.lol. owh ...just thank you for the film. Hates or likes.
Im really looking forward to the release of this film.
of coarse humans and Dinosaurs can co-exist... 🥩🍗 they would invite us over for diner all the time. 😲
I’m so hype!
Loved the movie but some parts are boring within . All fine it is the part of the script.
Whoo its so epic i seen in the movie 😚
"I Hate it When they used Richard Attenborough Voice!😣 It Just WRONG!😡I Hate It! 

1993 What a Wonderful time that Must Have Been.😭"
They kept grasshoppers more than dinosaurs and 50% of them are only raptors
Disappointing I really wanted to like this one
This looks more a videogame with bad graphics than a movie.
I'm so excited for this movie 🍿
what a great movie. Jk this dumb. A pointless sequel.
"best way to put this movie

just alright."
Gonna watch this weekend
Is this good?
Why this movie came out first on México ?? Friday 3
Por que esta película salio primero en México?? Viernes 3
Good movie saw it same day
I wanna see this
"Wow! Blue got a kid of their own and Maisie is all grown up and she wants to train with the dinosaurs. Chris Platt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Dewanda Wise, and many more were so incredibly talented and superb in this Jurassic World Dominion movie. I am definitely going to watch it during the Christmas season."
"Literally just saw the movie… it’s not bad at all. Not your average dinosaur movie, but it helps us realize how f’d up our world currently is"
3d film???
It's literally about Locust in the world instead of dinosaurs in the world
they not lying about being epic
QUETZALCOATLUS!!! ITS ACTUALLY QUETZALCOATLUS!
This was the absolute WORST movie of the franchise Complete GARBAGE 👎👎
I cant wait to see the dinosaurs morb the humans.
29 years later the Dilophosaurus returns to the big screen!
this looks so dumb.
Wtf let's goooo today is June 10
A good movie the best movie this year y'all.
Does that clone kid get eaten?
"Tomorrow I will go to the theater to see this movie, one of my favorite movie Jurassic World"
heck yeah let's gooooo
“Life finds a way.”
Blue vs Utaraptor?
Whats with Tim Cook character !!!
Pachyrhinosaurus should appear.
Plateosaurus would be nice.
I would like too see Nothosaurus in the movie.
It would be nice to see Sarah Harding again.
:0
The people who made this definitely play Ark survival evolved 💯. They put every dinosaur from the game in this movie.
Holy crap I’m definitely going to my local theater tomorrow to watch this bad mamba Jamba !!!!!!
This movie better not get hated
"Been there, seen it all like i thought, then the biggest comes out and am like ""why do they always do they have to come bigger?"""

Baby Blueeee :DD
Waauwwhh 🧢🧡💞🍀/* Xxxxx
"I still remember, it was my 1st day in kindergarten and that day Jurassic park (the very 1st one) was broadcasted on TV... Upon returning early from school, my parents made me watch it for the 1st time... Later, I've heard from them that I was terrified of the movie and did swear not to watch movies with dinosaurs ever again. Let's skip the in between. Now I'm in college and my semester exam is from next week. But, THIS. IS. IMPORTANT. This is fact.

Truthfully, both of my parents loved the 1st Jurassic park so much. They both went to watch it in theatre even though they aren't really into movies that much. And this time, they asked me if I wanna go to the movie. Generally, as every household, I'm not allowed to engage in such distractive things from a few days before exam... But this hits different to everyone... I'm kind of feeling bad for them coz they are old and can't go for the movie for various reasons but I've promised I'll get the movie on my device from torrent after a few months and then they can watch it... I can feel that both of them are excited. 🥺❤️"
"It's nice Sam Neill and Laura Dern are back, but come on: enough already. Even the first movie wasn't very good -- not a patch on the novel -- and this one reportedly is very problematic."
"Just watched it. Extremely poor dialogue, full diversity and woke. Don't waste your money on this crap!"
How was the movie? Is it worth the money?
"Just watched
Flight scene is good in middle.
Climax is ok.
Overall movie is ok.
Rating :⭐⭐⭐"
Waste movie ever.. 😬🥴
"“You coming or what?”

I already did 😏"
DAMN.

Flop

Baby blue baby blue baby blue baby blue baby blue Baby blue!!!!!!!!
"Watched this movie last night, it was epic and scary at the same time. Also i have a toy that is called the Thermizinosaurus, it is noisy but cool."
I love the humans having to learn to figure out how to deal with a fuckton of dinosaurs
Op op op op
Is blues child a male?
I must say.....Michael Crichton would be proud.....
"I know this is the last but I think they could still continue on it! Right? Don't have to really follow it what was stated, NO ONE GIVES A SHT! JUST CONTINUE THE JURASSIC FRANCHISE

please"
"Hey everybody 🦕 🦖 make sure to tune into this awesome new 🎥 movie🍿 hopefully it’s not the last one they make also I would appreciate it if everybody could go look at the video I made on this movie 

It’s a personal preview on what I think it’s going to be about sorry thank you 🙏"
Wow
দারুন
i'm from Viet Nam and i like this movie
"""Monster Metaphors Attack Again --  Worse than Ever"""
Maisie is so cute
IN CINEMA HAS THE JURASSIC WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It was a pretty good film, Jeff Goldblum was amazing,
what an era of movies!"
JUST AWFUL MOVIE   SAVE YOUR MONEY
"amazing movie, my favourite moment was when he morbed all those jurassics"
I can't wait to see it
TERRIBLE MOVIE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
Good movie ❤🌹👌
Baisy growed alot or is it daisy idk but she is so tall
Hollywood fairytale again hahah
New gibrid (sorry my english language very bad) is Skorpius rex
"holy shit, who cares if the movie was sucks? best cinematic ever!"
"Bruh writer of this movie gotta face my anger fist cause of bad ass storyline, its about dinosaur why make stink ass grasshopper a main problem in this movie"
just watched and its sucks honestly dont expect too much bc its literally mediocre BUT I LOVE THE NEW CHARACTERS THOOO
Please continue the Jurassic park Franchise films
"The thing I liked about this movie:
The couple from the last two movies are still together for a rare change, and they are GOOD together. Their relationship made me smile and made me want to see more of them at that cute cabin. 

The rest of the plot was way OTT. Did you really need a new bad guy, creating NEW dino's"
I could do wo Chris Pratt. The old school JP group is an amazing group of actors and I hope they are a dominate part of this movie. They are who I'm going to go see. I remember seeing them in the 90s AT A MOVIE THEATER with my Grami and I am for sure going to see this in theaters and have her there w me in spirit ❤️
"Just watch already todays 
The movie awsome because old cast in jussic park and world back you that nice.
 My father have you watch all so he go to cinema with me he want to watch agin"
"Cheesy ass movie, bad acting, bad cinematography.. i couldn’t wait for the movie to end"
Loved JP as a child and will def be watching this.
Dinosaurs might be instinct…but Jurassic park never will! I love these movies 🍿
i cant wait ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I think dinosaurs were waaaay more larger than this movie made them to be.
"My first thought is that these species of dinosaur could not stand those freezing temps. Look at their skin, there is no fur! They’d be hibernating or just die. Good god people are uneducated these days. Won’t be seeing this rubbish"
"Childhood to Menhood ,thanku Jurassic world❤️"
Hell yeah the OG characters returning.
"Looks Shit! This franchise has been used, abused and raped for every penny ever since Lost World! Should have ended then!"
Dinosaurs grow so fast 😢🙂
"Just saw it today, fan service and no bone to it's plot. Only great efects, same old silly ""funny"" jokes, somehow there is a girl who is suposed to be the savior of the world, etc. Sadly for me, it's not a good movie by any means."
I've booked the ticket and I'm very excited
Bring back Jurassic park. I miss the dinos in the nature.
"Literally Nobody,
Me after watching Chris Pratt:- *The Murderer Of Iron Man* 🤣🤣"
"Alright Universal, hear me out:
So all the dinosaurs are have escaped the park and are running rampant on the island of Isla Nublar. Chris Pratt is riding around on Blue the Velociraptor in an attempt to capture them and put them back into their exhibits. They come across an abandoned street; It's night and they're alone... Then all of sudden, a loud black blur swiftly and quickly circles around them going around and around, fogging up both Pratt's and Blue's vision. The blur stops directly in front of the pair and the smoke begins to settle, revealing what is now sitting face-to-face with him and Blue... A Dodge Charger... *Cue Spanish music* It's Dom Tor-freaking-etto. Dom with his hand on the steering wheel, locking eyes with Pratt, then says, ""I hear Velociraptors make for a pretty good bounty... And I could use a new set of wheels"". This is reciprocated by a screech from Blue. ""Heh-."" Dom chuckles as he begins to rev up his engine, ""Clever girl.""

*I'm still working out the kinks, but Dom eventually has a change of heart and returns Blue with the other Velociraptors. The last scene is going to compromise the camera zooming in on Dom's smiling face as he watches Blue reuniting with her pack... ""It's all about family."""
"I'm seeing
It on Friday so soon I'm so e ited"
Stupid cod
I remember seeing the original Jurassic park in the cinema way back in 1993 I couldn't get a ticket I had to come back later that day I wasn't disappointed now I'm going back to see the end of this epic story nearly 30 Years later wow time flies long live the Jurassic movie's 👍
WE GET TO SEE THE DILOPHOSAURUS AGAIN LETS GOOO
Just saw it. Boring as hell. What a way to end the Jurassic saga. Good job script writers 👏
WE have gotten a long way away from jurassic park
ONLY 30 HOURS BOIII😎👍💙
I just saw it and was completely bored out of my mind. I didn't think it was possible for a movie filled with action and dinosaurs to have literally nothing interesting happen but they pulled it off.
so excited for this! been waiting.
"oh my god, the part of Alan and Ellie took me off guard..."
fun fact dinosaurs wouldn’t be this big even if we somehow made em today because there is not as much oxygen as it used to be (back when dinosaurs lived)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
"watched it. It was quite boring aqtually, they focused more on smthing else than dinosaurs."
I love you waiting for you.... 😘😘😘😘
Saw Jurassic Park when I was 8 years old... equally excited to see this one again with my 8 year old!
"Just came back from watching Dominion. All I can do is ... Sigh (heavily). I would rank this one the lowest among all 6th movies in the franchise. Many missed opportunities on top of cliché lines, underutilised former casts in terms of their return and the end climax was like ""meh""... Kinda sad though coz I loved Jurassic Park, Jurassic World and Jurassic Park 2 (Jurassic Park 3 used to be the worst of the franchise but now no more). Not sure if it's bad editing, or bad script or bad directing, or perhaps all of the above. 😔😔"
"Goldblum, Neill and Dern. The only reason I will go see this. For me, after the 1st two movies, the franchise sort of lost its cache...probably because the CGI in the first 2 was so novel for the times. But seeing those 3 onscreen, together again in a Jurassic movie...OH YEAH!"
I watch this movie it's awesome I watch 3 Jurassic world movies
alan the best
"AN ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT! Do not, under no circumstances waste your time and money on this crap! By far, one of the ultimate disasters. Bland on every front and a good way to waste your money! A mistake I will never do again. The jurassic saga ended with a tremendous failure!"
same movie over 20 years.
I just saw the movie
I just seeing and perfect
And I am Carson
I can’t wait to see it I love Jurassic world
One of the best films this year. Just came back from the cinema!
"the rebuild of the dinosaurs is too bad, sad"
"I watched Jurassic World/Park since I was 4, never cried and still watch it."
I watched this movie
Woa
I'm from Brazil and I've already watched the movie I say I loved it I've never missed a Jurassic world movie
I'am so exited to see the movie ıt looks pretty even in the trailer
When did Chris Pratt become William Afton?
The second writer the new that was your movie right now
I love dinosaurs
I’m going on June teth
The logo doesn't count. Even the answer I saw
ONLY 36 HOURS BOIII😎👍💙
Can’t wait to see it! I’ve loved the franchise since day one.
This
Ahh
"Bro an actor from dhar mann is acting here
But honestly she deserves this , she’s an amazing actor"
1:14 - I thought they were gonna reuse the Morbius Für Elise OST here lol
Who can give me the trailer’s soundtrack ?
Dominion Dominion
Top gun Jurassic world and light year. Pretty good series of movies. My 6 year old is going to be spoiled.  Lol.
"### PRE-Watching: I'm NOT excepting to see a good movie at all!!! It shall never be the same as the original JP 1993 by any means. However: I'll watch it 2-4 times in theaters to enjoy the effects (sound and visual); seeing dinosaurs jumping, smashing, killing, destroying ... etc. Moreover: Seeing out beloved trio JP 1993 characters back in conjunction with JW characters. Let's be realistic: It's 100% fake idea of having humans and  dinosaurs  co-exist, so we should never take the movie that serious."
But u any of them gets killed
After all the incident and many people died.. finally the genius scientist think human and dinosaur cannot live together
I am so excited for this in 2 days
In this series next part come i e. Jurassic world Dominion bcz of that small girl who opens the cage of all dinosaur at the end of Jurassic world fallen kingdom 😂😂
I just can't wait!!! Growing up with this jurassic!! Never Missed! and please DO NOT STOP !!!!
Why the review is so bad in IMDB? Only got 6.2 😭
They said it would be connected to camp cretaceous a wonder how?
They really need to stop and I’m sorry but I know Bryce Dallas Howard is Ron Howard’s daughter but the nepotism is so over the top
🤓
I hope they can save blue & her baby
How they not kill the dinos yet ?????
Steven Spielberg should of directed this fullstop
"Just saw Jurassic World Dominion... It's a Masterpiece... Wonderful... Magical... The characters and the dinosaurs are great... Anybody who is saying this movie is not good enough doesn't understand the progress and evolution in dinosaur study... This is coming from me, a Vertebrate Paleontologist..."
"쥬라기월드 팬인데 이게 마지막이라고
해서 아쉽습니다"
Me love Jurrasic world Dominion
"It's gonna fucking suck. It's a safe hollywood movie and it's gonna suck balls. They *MIGHT* kill off 1 or 2 OG characters but other than that it's gonna be a boring ass vanilla by the numbers hollywood film. You know what would be dope tho? Is if they waited right till the last 5 minutes of the movie and had the dinosaurs violently maul, rip and tear all the humans to shreds with no cuts and no pussying out on the gore. And then the movie just ends. *NOW THAT WOULD BE A MOVIE WORTH WATCHING!*"
Childhood duo and New duo perfect casting
Nice movie
Oh my goodness I can't wait to see this!!!
This what star lord did during the blip
BEHOLD!! The Mosasaur
Who else is hyped for Jurassic world dominion? 😁😁😁😁🦕🦖🦕
There aren’t any “ Frankenstein dinosaurs” in this one are there? No Indo-raptor or giant monster t-Rex is there?
Are they going to explain what became of isla sorna in this movie?
whO's that tiny little guy with the blue.? 😍😍😍😍 thank yOu sO much fOr bringing back blue again. I've waited fOr this mOment tO see her again 💕
"that soo funny having recently started playing ark a lot's , while watching the trailer i was like oh it's a therinasaurus , ooh a dilo ect ect xD btw the trailer is fire !!!"
"Life,will find a way"
Who else is here after watching planet dinosaur?
Who else was spinosaurus back?
so pumped to see this
"Just hearing Richard Attenborough's voice at the beginning was enough to give me chills. Mr Jurassic Park himself, It was a nice addition to the trailer along with all of the original cast knowing he couldn't be there in person."
"I saw Jurassic Park in theaters with my parents and loved it, now my 5 and 2 yr old get to experience what I did in theater. Both love the newer cast too, so I'm looking forward to it and buying new toys at Target for Christmas hehe."
Ok this trailer if I seen this 5 or more honestly as am Maltese love seeing my home my capital Valletta showing my Malta pure awesomeness looking forward see it in cinema honestly worth seeing it  thank you

Yo ya la vi esta muy buena
I’m also a sucker for dinosaurs in cities but I love how this movie will be the final one I can’t wait to watch on my sister at her house this is gonna be so good oh my gosh shout out to lkit claw
I am so excited for the new Jurassic park movie. My whole family is going to watch it😁
gotta see this in the big theater.
"Thats why ? I always play ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVED, even built my own Jurassic Park base."
i love this movies
A scenario of my childhood. Dinosaurs always are a symbol of smth terrible happening.
"Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill's presence in this film was a clever idea,a great generation Gap filler.Can't wait to see it!"
"ah yes william aftons reference ""i always come back"""
Can't wait to see the movie in theaters on june 10th. I love this franchise and can't wait to see it again.
Can't wait to see the OG cast 💯 .  Still love the first movie 🍿🎥
"Dumbest sequel ever, seriously, it takes awhile for a plot to happen and it's not about the dinosaurs. Its about locusts and some girl and a villain scientist (nothing new) the film reminds me of fast and furious with drag racers becoming 007 and Jurassic Palaeontologists and a raptor trainer  becoming 007 as well who stops evil scientists, i was waiting for them to go into space."
"When I was a kid, my aunt brought me to cinema and watch this. NOW, I am already an adult, I bring my aunt's daughter to watch it"
Beta right?
This Frenchise identify the the real image of dinasor
ONLY 2 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
so exciting to see Sam Neil back!!!
난 베타가 너무 귀여웠어😙
"When do they start attacking Orientals for not having eyes? They do, but there not round. They have a stupid Agenda for everybody, Black man and the white woman thing even though 99.999% of black men are dating their own women. Black women and the hair thing, and why is Wonder Woman running around in yes, you got it, Platforms when you can't even stand upright in platforms. Who in the White entertainment industry is behind these ridiculous Agendas??"
Офигеть новый сезон  я тут походу один русский
2:13 THEY BRING QUETZALCOATLUS! I'M DEAD!!
Not long until blue the raptor would trained as MI6
1:38 is that Jacky Chan
와 대박
"I gotta say, the saw pitch drop at 00:26 is hot shit"
If blue has a kid who’s the dad
"So, where did all of these dinosaurs come from? Is someone cloning more of them or has there been like a decade time skip i missed? This seems like alot more dinosaurs then were released in the last one."
Watched the movie.. And well.. Dodgson! Dodgson! They have Dodgson in it!
they need to add the titanaboa cuz it would look great!
waited so desperately.....now very excited to watch
everytime i see the logo of a trex big head and tiny little hands it reminds me of Barney.
I like when they hand touch the dinosaurs that LET them touch and the tapping of the toe nail. It's like when we do the one finger tap. Their both - okay I'm mad now. 😅♥️
Hell yeah!
This is a top veadio
What a trailer oh my god
"When he says I always come back 
Me-IS HE WILLIAM AFTON OR SOMETHING?"
Dinosaur don’t even look real nomore wtf happen
I hope it's better than the last few.
"My question is, if Blue was the last of her kind, how did she have a kid?"
I cant wiat for the movie
Come back i awlays come back 😍
😊😊😊
"Cant argue that special effects have gotten amazing over the years..... however props to the effects people, all the way back in 1993. While we sat in the theatre and watched as the kids were sitting in the 'tour driving' Ford Explorers, that cup of water began to vibrate, with each step of the T-Rex. To think the slightest and easiest of effects, still rain supreme after all these years! Bravo Spielberg!"
Every kid in the movie' aman:hey kid get out of there the little kid:im scared
Make Sure U Watch It At Your Local AMC THEATERS!!!
Man I love this franchise!!!!
Esse filme é um LIXÃO
So looking forward to this!
"oh,Blue is a girl"
lizards in the cold luls..
Bro I honestly used to be scared of this movie when I was little but now I love it < 3
Eu já assisti o filme no cinema e muito legal
"I've watched Jurassic Park in a theatre with my dad when i was 10. I remembered that time watching this,  cast of original Jurassic Park have returned. Just amazing. Movie will release soon and i'll watch it in an Imax saloon. This will be epic."
Já assistir o filme muito top
POV: you are the Giga chad who still watches this trailer
🇨🇱🇺🇸🌐🧡🌐🇺🇸🇨🇱
:)
Must see this Movie on Wed here in Germany with my Family
"Alan Grant is Jurassic Park for me, about time!"
I grew up on Jurassic world… so excited
Best sequel ever! 👌🏻
I remember when I was 6 and I had first got the Indominus rex toy for Christmas I was so happy cause I was obsessed with the model of the dinosaur and how it could camouflage. And I was obsessed with dinosaurs in general and seeing the old cast takes me back to my childhood. I miss those days
"This is the most pathetic film release planing in JP series. More then half the world locations have not seen the movie but we know the ending scenes and others. This is rediculous strategy, never seen it before !"
Welcome back dr.alan
I can’t wait!!!!!!!!
"Nothing new in the movie, first half is toooooo slow blah blah blah. I wait eagerly everytime for Jurassic part but there new releases are not more promising and convincing. Like they can do much much better, but they are losing that spark in Jurassic franchise. Old series (first 3 parts) hold us till the end what will happen next. New series ok i knew what will be going to happen next 🤷‍♂️ common"
I'm not going to lie; this looks awesome.
"Whether dino broke the plane, or flip his car, or directly jump on hero
He won't going to die😁😁😁"
this movie amazing but one thing I don't know movie release date 10 June 2022 but I see this movie 4 June how this possible I don't know
Why am I always crying when I watch Jurassic Park/World movies
I am excited to see this   I love Jurassic.
SO DUMB...  They made dinosoars live in cold and snow and be able to swim to help the soy boys squirt.  no science on how cold blood works..
SO DUMB...  They made dinosoars live in cold and snow and be able to swim to help the soy boys squirt.  no science on how cold blood works..
Go Woke Go Broke....
I just saw baby Raptor blue
"The interview and the trailers got me very excited and my expectations high.
Now I've seen the film and ... I'm rather disappointed. I guess I better save the details to avoid spoilers."
OH IS BLUE IS GIRL?
I'M REALLY EXITED!
What title of movie is it im really ready it's cool 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆!!!!!!!!!
"This was indeed a combination and recurrances of old characters merging with the new , lots of repeating  old scenes of past franchises and rehashes , wasn't as fresh as the first jurassic park and jurassic world but old frens like dilophosaurus and triceraptops are back and new faces like giant locusts ..pretty neat movie"
I am going to watch it on 10 Jun......brua
Ada yang dari Indonesia gak ya?
Zack Snyder justice league 😎i spent a lot of time to devide us ....
ONLY 3 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Can’t wait to watch this in 4DX.
"If you could STOP giving away spoilers in your trailers, that'd be fuckin great. - Especially when the trailers are pushed on us, through ad services(Spotify and such)"
is that indominus rex ??🤯🤯
After no way home. Now this!!!!!!!!!! To many emotions dude!!!
why am i crying
"New Jurassic Park Movie with original actors in it! 
The fans: Oh hell yeah this looks fucking amazing!!!

New Jurassic park movie but let’s hypothetically take the original cast out! 
The fans: This movie looks trash as fuck wtf is even going on here? 

The fact that every, single, comment is about the original actors is very telling. That’s the ONLY exciting thing about this damn letdown. The Location, the story and the backtracked dinosaurs (No more, Spinosaurus, mutated T-Tex, mutated Velociraptor, matter fact let’s backtrack  into all the old non scarier Dino’s, bet the fans will be terrified after we build up the dino’s the last 3 movies and then cut all the way back to the original) really make this shit just feel all over the place and random as hell. Imma still watch it and it will still gross massive amounts of money but I think it’s going to be terrible."
"Bro am I the only one that wasn’t blown away by this trailer at all aside from the returning original cast? Like the location feels weird as fuck, nobody looks “Trapped” or “stuck” here. It literally looks like they all are in some older city obviously not located in the USA, dinosaurs were let loose and, that’s it. That’s the movie."
😍😍😍
Amazing
No I don't wanna believe that this is the last film of the franchise..this legendary franchise should be continued for years to come for the future generations.
The dinosaur at ~26 seconds syncing up with the music is the stupidest fucking thing ever
I wish Koolasuchus will appear in the movie.
Not gonna lie it's good oxygen levels are lower because I can't even imagine flying knowing there's a Quetzalcoatlus flying nearby
Omg this looks epic!!!
Silly Owen grady the line I always come back is trade marked by William afton also amazing trailer
I would like to see Gorgonops.
Silly Owen  grady the line I Alayna come back is trade marked by William afton
"I would love to see Archelon, Sarcosuchus, Titanoboa, Megalania, Dimetrodon, Postusuchus, Megalodon, Dunkleosteus, Tanystropheus, Eryops, Diplocaulus, Scutosaurus, Placerias, Metriorhynchus, Shonisaurus, Tapejara, Anhanguera, Rhamphorynchus, Edaphosaurus, Archaeopteryx and Xiphactinus."
I would love to see Barbaridactylus
Can't wait 🥺🥺🥺🥺for ❤❤❤ my favorite adventure
I would like to see Masiakasaurus
I would like to see Majungasaurus.
"I would like to see Amargasaurus, Argentinosaurus, Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, Coelophysis, Corythosaurus, Dryosaurus, Einiosaurus, Microceratus, Edmontosaurus, Gigantoraptor, Heterodontosaurus, Hypsilophodon, Iguanodon, Kentrosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Megalosaurus, Microraptor, Ouranosaurus, Oviraptor, Pachycephalosaurus, Psittacosaurus, Saurolophus, Styracosaurus, Torosaurus, Troodon, Tuojiangosaurus, Utahraptor, Tsintaosaurus, Concavenator, Seismosaurus, Polacanthus and Oryctodromeus."
I would like to see Albertosaurus in the movie.
Ever since I watched the first jurassic world movie I always loved the mosasauras and seeing it for only 3 seconds in this trailer has hyped me up so much for this movie.
Wow jurrasic world dominion
I just watched the previous movie and I thought there were only 11 species released in the wild? What's the explanation for suddenly a bazillion of different dinos are in the wild? Pretty sure the traffickers didn't cage Quetzals and theris... Or is it just a new plot?
"1:57
I can't take that phrase seriously anymore  \(￣︶￣*\))"
I think this movies gonna be like Space Jam 3 coming out June 9th
I'm so overwhelmed with nostalgia I had to go back and watch the trex cup ripples scene 5 times.
I just realized John Hammond is quoted at the beginning
Wow could we get over dinosaurs films lol. This is so 90's and irrelevant and will always be anyway..
"Personally, I found the movie disappointing. The story got a bit long-winded and started to bore myself a bit in the cinema."
cap
"Knowing the original cast is in this one, I think I’ll finally watch the other JW’s. (Does anyone else feel like the trailer music is similar to Justice League??)"
i have a question dont dinosaurs be exdigt
"Seems like 2022 is full of great movies. Bullet Train, Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, The Lost City,  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, The Contractor, ..... And many more coming. Boy do I love myself these movies..."
i wish they bring back the spinosaurus
OMG i love jurassic world.
No T-rex no party
Dinosaurs are just plain cool
We need the #Hammond prequel !
"Yo! Thanks for this!!!
I'm excited for this! 3 DAYS!!!!
WELL DONE UNIVERSAL FOR THIS!!!!!:)
I just guess this is the end of Jurassic world!!! This makes me cry so much! ^__^"
It is so cool
ONLY 4 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
i thought blue didn't grow HAHHAHAHAH cutieeee bluee
"been fan of dino's since i was a kid. the first dino movie I've watched was dinosaur 2000. I'm happy that this movie (Jurassic world) madee... can't wait to watch the full movie.
ps: I've watched all movie of JW💗💗"
with the giganotosaurus it is so cool
so coooooooooooooollllllllll!
blue ate Owens hand
Just saw the movie. Its great!!
"I was a teenager when I fell in love with Jurassic and then my kids did the same years later.
I can't wait for this movie."
I think they should leave the dinosaurs alone.
"I saw the movie and Im disappointed, I was expecting the same quality as the others, to WOKE for me."
That is what we waiting for...
I love the some of the original cast are here. Funny story. I only watch JW for the Dinosaurs.
Wow
Dinos look worse in todays cgi than in '93.
Epic movie for sure also i'm  happy  they continue with the parts
Thank goodness they're ending this crap the only good one was the first one
I like to hug older women
Come on Stat lord..🔥
I wish I could watch this in theatres it looks good.
not complaining or anything but could someone please explain why it’s only the raptors that run a little funny ??
"i have read today that Jurassic World 3 is going to be a woke movie. So, i will not pay for it... and i will put everything Jurassic objects/toys that i have in boxes in my closet.... And i will never give 1 dollar for this franchise again in my life. Fock 2022 Woke agendas, i will go watch Rambo, Rocky, The Godfather, JAWS and Back To The Future : real movies without woke agenda."
So its now basically how to train ur dragon? Or dinosaur
"Buena, pero pudieron aprovechar mejor a los personajes antiguos, en especial a Alan Grant."
"Someone og is gonna die, i'm calling it now"
just got done watching the movie online what a shitty movie this is worse than jurassic world fallen kingdom half of the movie aint even about dinosaurs its about enlarged beetles eating all the worlds crops
0:27 I love that roar it’s so beautiful
"Been watching these since I was a kid, now I get to take my grand daughter  and get her started 😊"
Fucking trash movie
I see this trailer everyday
"Please...just ONCE....show Bryce Dallas Howard getting eaten...slowly...by one of the dinosaurs.  That's the only way I'd watch this millionth installment of this tired franchise.  In fact, I'd probably skip the whole rest of the movie but would rewind and rewatch the scene over...and over.... and over... and over...."

"Not in my entire life (15yo) have I ever been more excited to watch the jurrasic franchise, as a little kid my mom bought a vhs movie of jurrasic park I was around 4 years old and jurrasic park was my most favorite movie of all, so she bought more movies of jurrasic but there were only very few I only had I think 2 or 3 movies of jurrasic park. Thus franchise is my childhood and I will always love the movies, they haven't over done it they have made everything like if it was the cherry on top please keep it up don't change a lot it would brake many people's hearts of the jurrasic world and park franchise"
Never stop with making jurrasic world
That black woman was certainly not needed. Always with these black quota characters. Always ruining the immersion. Forced wastage of space on screen.
Wow wow wowwow i didnt watch any film from this
At Mayan 14
Is it any good I'ma see it Friday
Cant wait
Chris Pratt and Sam Neil as a duo 🥶🥶
Dayum this movie used up all universal studio's budget huh?
Having back the old cast is different kind of pleasure 😇
"*You can already tell it's going to be cheesy and far fetched* CGI just keeps killing the movies the whole thrilling experience has evaporated even when in the cinema where it's at it's best, shame."
Loved it broo
"""The epic conclusion of the Jurassic era.""

Then what about Camp Cretaceous season 5, eh?"
All the people who played ark survival prob stargazing right now 😏
remastered movie
Sam Neill...still hot
"Um... How the hell did they get off the island? Like maybe the flying or swimming ones, but the rest? And how the hell weren't they destroyed by military? I mean all they need is one nuke for the island, a few fighter jets for the flying ones and torpedoes for the swimming ones"
ONLY 5 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Yg ni klua 9 Jun. Sape nk ikut. sila isi nama penuh dgn ic kt bawah.
This movie needs to be renamed Locust World
Are these auto... rotica?
Dinosaurs can't  live in cold climate. They became extinct when planet was beginning to get colder. Then how could the dinosaurs live in polar regions in this movie?
"What would be so good is if Alan Grant sees the old T-Rex from Jurassic Park 1 and he's like ""Don't move. She can't see you if you don't
 move"" but the T-rex remembers him and kind of nuzzles his hand a bit to show him she is now a friendly Rex. She stoops down so that Grant can mount her back. Then Grant jumps on to her and rides her over to Malcolm. Malcolm kind of chuckles and does that weird laugh he does. Suddenly the T-rex drops a huge turd with bits of Gennaro's half-digested clothes in it. Grant looks sheepish. Malcolm turns to the camera: ""When you gotta go you gotta go""."
"""Welcome to grasshopper world"""
Conclusion!! WTF?
Hans zimmer make music??
Don’t watch it. It is the worst of the six movies. Not kidding
Og dilo
I Love that Sequels are bringing back the Stars that made it Famous... like Spider-Man No Way Home.... ECT
Disappointed 😞
ALMOST a bad movie. Not that good.
They got the originals back!? Hell yeah this is going to top the others.
Not that Jurassic Park was ever grounded in reality but how tf did we end up here .... like progression from the og one when I was a little kid to this is just mind blowing.
"To be honest, I always rooted for the dinos. I was not sad when ppl were eaten but would cry when dinos were mistreated."
Grant is back!
What age is this movie appropriate for? I have 6 and 4 years olds. Anyone know if I can take them to see this movie?
BLUE AND HER BABY ARE SO FRICKIN ADORABLE
"AAAAAAA SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Just have to figure out if we're going to see it in theaters, or go to a drive-in"
I think the original cast/movie is SO much better than the new cast/movies.   That will be the only reason I watch this.  The original Jurassic Park was the best 💯💯
Looks like an amazing movie. Excellent minds.!
"1:57 ""I always come back""

Taking notes from his father in law, I see."
Idk how but it’s already in the cinema where I’m from so
"⚫🟠🦖🌆🦕🌇💥Next Week Until Jurassic World: DOMINION hits in theaters, is anyone here getting nervous, I am definitely ! 💥🌇🦕🌆🦖🟠⚫"
Blue has a kid oh my but how
I can't WAIT to see this movie@!!!!!!!!
So happy that the original cast is part of this still. To see them in this trailer gave me chills
My favorite movie is finally coming to an end
"It's another of those movies where special effects is more spectacular than the actual plot. A weak plot = a dull movie, no matter how amazing the special effects are."
"I feel like this is going to be the biggest shit of a disappointment, but I need to watch this."
"This shit is Last Jedi of the Jurassic series. The entire plot is about saving the world against bigass locusts & dinosaurs are barely 10% of the whole running time. This fucking scam called ""trailer"" bluffs so much about ""how humans coexist with dinosaurs"" BS but dinosaurs are NOT even part of the story LMAO. Not to mention that they completely wasted Grant and other characters with subpar writing."
Mission Park: Impossible Dinosaur !!!!
"ONLY 7,I mean 6 DAYS BOIII, APPARENTLY IN MY THEATER IT COMES OUT THURSDAY NIGHT 9TH NOT 10TH😎👍💙"
"‘Jurassic World Dominion’ Dominates Mexico With Franchise-Best Wednesday Previews – International Box Office
Universal/Amblin Entertainment’s Jurassic World Dominion stormed into Mexico on Wednesday with $3M worth of previews. That’s the best opening preview performance in the rebooted franchise, overtaking 2018’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom by 53% and 2015’s Jurassic World by 81%. Both of the earlier films had sneaks on a holiday.

As we noted yesterday, the Colin Trevorrow-directed Dominion is putting its dino-print out in 15 early overseas markets this weekend, ahead of the domestic bow on June 10. Projections for the current international box office frame are at $45M+, though we’ll have a clearer picture tomorrow as more numbers emerge, including from rollout in Brazil, Hong Kong and Italy.
Regarding Mexico, the $3M yesterday represents the market’s 3rd biggest opening since the beginning of the pandemic and is topped only by Spider-Man: No Way Home while 15% behind Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness when comparing Wednesday starts. Technically, Doctor Strange and JWD were both in previews on a Wednesday, though the releases are just about as big as an opening day.
Chris Pratt/Bryce Dallas Howard-starrer Dominion, which also welcomes back legacy cast including Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, took 88% market share in Mexico on Wednesday and ranked No. 1 in all theaters. It also had the 3rd best opening for UPI behind Fate Of The Furious and Furious 7.
 
Also as previously noted, JWD stomped into Korea on Wednesday with $6M for the 4th biggest opening day of all time in the market — and the top pandemic-era bow. Wednesday was the Election Day holiday and there was sharp drop-off today as a result. The two-day cume there is now $7.1M.

Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live — and hunt — alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history’s most fearsome creatures.
 
The latest installment in the $5B+ franchise also features new cast members DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, Dichen Lachman, Scott Haze and Campbell Scott. Returning cast includes BD Wong, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda and Omar Sy.  
 
The screenplay is by Emily Carmichael and Trevorrow from a story by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow, based on characters created by Michael Crichton. Producers are Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley. Executive produces are Steven Spielberg, Alexandra Derbyshire and Trevorrow"

Nice movie 👍
I hope they won't f*ck up the storyline just like Kong vs Godzilla.
Looks scarier than all the others put together! Can't wait!
is it only me that thinks the dinosaurs are VERY SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE 🥰😍😍😍😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰
stop with the movies already. soon this will be just fast and the furious 😂
What the …. Dino whisper / jetti save your money just getting stupider
"This looks bad and like a whole lot of none sense.
But I will still watch it and support it. Simply for the fact that I want new generations to have their high budget dinosaur movie to possibly spark a new passion / possible career."
you guys are great with tech geez

"Mid af, just walked out of the theater so tired omg"
"I just walked out of the theater, it was absolutely terrible. The plot is unironically boring, the writing seems to be done by a three-years-old that hasn’t even watched the other movies of the saga, the dinosaurs are forgettable, the dialogue is cheesy and most importantly there is no Spinosaur. The only thing I liked was that little thing they used to make the velociraptor sounds in JP III, it was in the background as an easter egg in one pf the first scenes with Alan Grant."
The new hybrid should be called the indoor axe
Hoy voy a llorar... Es maravilloso todo esto
"Ho appena visto il film in Anteprima Mondiale, non farò spoiler, voglio solo dire che è stato fantastico, non si poteva fare di meglio, il film ha citazioni riguardanti tutta la raccolta di film ""Jurassic"". Davvero Fantastico, volevo ringraziare il regista Colin Trevorrow e tutto il cast senza dimenticare il ""lavoro dietro le quinte"". Un ringraziamento a Sam Neill, Laura Dern e Jeff Goldblum, siete stati fantastici! Passate tutti una buona giornata!

TheFox"
"I guess we can make rockets powerful enough to destroy massive, heavily armored tanks, which would easily . . . E-A-S-I-L-Y . . . kill even the largest dinosaur in this movie, and we can build bombs and rockets powerful enough to destroy massive cities, and we have technology to go to the moon and back. But we can't stop dinosaurs from taking over the world. It's almost like this is FICTION! FUN fiction!"
Can't wait 🤩🤩🤩
'Humans and Dinosaurs can't coexist'... no fucking shit and water is wet lol what is this writing man
👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖
I actually teared up watching this trailer. I have been following Jurassic park since I was young and can't wait to watch them all with my kids!!
It looks 👎🏽
This disaster happen because one clone girl released them 😒
ONLY 8 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Is the trex here going to be the Original Rexy?
A great moviee!!
I can’t wait to see this movie! 🍿🥤
Super fan of Jurassic since I was a child and seeing these OG casts... ahh! I love it!😍
"It's like they literally never learned their sesson from all the other tes where people died from a ""mistake"" 

LITERALLY THE ENTIRETY OF THE JURASSIC FRANCHISE IN A NUTSHELL:
News reporter: And in other news, another tragic loss of people after another mishaps with the dinosaurs that have been brought back 4 years ago. This is the 12th incident that has happened ever since that time. 

Dinosaur advocates: we should and need to protect the dinosaurs. They're innocent and sho no threat to humans. They're animals too and deserve to live."
Boring  only good one was the first one
"I wish one of the the characters will say

“ It’s morbin time “ before Jaeger pilot come to save them"
I like this one !
"The movie Jurassic world is awesome
And you're welcome so moving insurance with the rented by I said who's the movie it was why is the Jurassic world movie The rented by"
They gonna get cooked.
Jurassic World Kidsongs
"Can't wait for this movie, I'm so glad the actor have reunion"
I can't wait see this movie I seeing all of them to growing up 🤣🤣🤣
"Where are charlie,delta,echo???"
This is going to be f ing fun
"I’ve been a huge fan of the Jurassic series. It is cool and sad at the same time, The cool thing is: I am really excited to see the 3rd movie of the Jurassic World lore. But the sad thing is: the series comes to an end.. *and it all goes down to this, exactly next week.*"
I'm not crying you are crying 😭
I won’t miss this one no matter what
in Memory of Richard Attenborough (1923 - 2014) 💐🙏
"it looks stupid, the first two were stupid, now lets see how stupid the audience is.

generic cgi nostalgia nothingness walmart"
"It was already released in South Korea yesterday and... there are many negative reviews and disappointed audiences. Now it's rated 6.81 out of 10 on Naver, the most visited website in Korea."
"The ""I always come back"" gives FNAF vibes"
"I am 48 now, i love watching it as first episode and it's actors, love you guys ummmaaaa"

Ugh. I can’t wait!!!!
"I have no clue how good or bad this movie will be, but I’m gonna enjoy it regardless!"
ONLY 9 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙

"The Grandmaster is in this?! Until we see him in the next Avengers: Endgame!
xD"
छिपकला बगीचा DOMINION
we're gonna milk the nostalgia for every dollar we can until we beat this franchise into the ground.
Phim này còn có hai bộ phim này rất hay Jurassic World
I hope there's a good explanation for all the dinos everywhere. Wasn't just a handful of them released in the last movie?
omg can't wait to see this movie epic
when I saw the first one I was shocked by how real those creatures were but when it came to the 'world' series I can tell all the dinosaurs are fake
I question whether blue would still take part in fights. Mainly because in the trailer we only see blue in the snow.
Welp. Time to watch them all in preparation for this!
gempak laaa. dinasour tgn kecik ada kepak kene modifit
1:00 Aquaman?
They kept Ellie and Alan broken up😭whyyyyy
"My thought as I began watching the trailer was ""what ludicrous b.s. will they come up with for this one"" and of course the first scene answered my question.. Dinosaurs in the snow! They should stop showing trailers for these tired played out movies. Watching the trailer just confirmed what I suspected which was that this movie doesn't appear to be worth watching."
I’ve waited too long!!!! I cannot wait to see this!!!
Chris Is purple guy apparently “ I always come back”
"Humans and the earth can’t co exist. There, fixed it for you."
Iam waiting. 👍👍👍..🦖🦖🦕🦕.. ( INDIA )KERALA 🌿).. 👹
Omg cant wait to see this movie its going to be so gooooood 😍
1:57 it's William afton omg
"Amazingly, this one seem's even worse than the previous two."
Terrific trailer. Hope the film lives up to it. It’s got to be more than just dinosaurs eating people….doesn’t it?
Jurrasic World: Dino Crisis.
ONLY 10 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"""why do they always have to go bigger?""
yeah, because more bigger more fun!"
If anything happens to Beta I will literally kill everyone in the world and then myself
"Not really a big fan of Jurassic World, but i am always obsessed with classic Jurassic Park Movies, if i ever got to see this one it will be for that original cast i admire, seeing them put back together again is going to be something!"
I wonder what will happen to the dinosaurs that got sold
It would be nice to see Zack and Gray again
Dope blue is a mother
this easily looks the best of the new trilogy
Ok how tf does that rex manage to get inside theatre/party instead of going ham before arriving in a goddamn building.
Blue Must be a Dad cuz he has a Kid and hes a legend
I have a feeling Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum are gonna die in this film.
POV your an ark play and freaked when you saw the quetzal
"I think if Michael Crichton were alive he would be flummoxed. I don’t think this was ever his intention. Same as Lucas though. The spark of the idea eventually becomes popcorn blockbuster that is continually exploited. Don’t get me wrong I will see this because I’ve stuck with Jurassic park since I owned the first movie on VHS when it was released and read the books multiple times. But there reaches a point where the original concept just gets lost in the special effects and it’s only because they know that audiences will flock to anything that retains that nostalgic legacy. See Halloween, Star Wars, etc. While I have no real beef with continual remakes since it’s blatantly a mindless money grab, I do find originality really is on life support. Atleast mainstream wise"
"Ive only watched on of the movie in the new franchise, and I'm not even sure which one it was, but these fucking composers really know how to add a little leitmotif, that takes you back to the time before you learned about the military industrial complex, and the Orwellian corporate technocracy that has enslaved the entire planet. 🥲 ***do do doo dooo sooooo***"
"Goddamn it how do these movies always get me, I really hope this one is at least as good as Jurassic world 1."
Bingo! Dino DNA.
The role of Owen having this power over raptors was stupid the first time why are they keeping that going? I don’t think I’m even going to watch it lol
Don't forget this movie's going to happen because of Claire's feelings over the dinosaurs from certain death in the previous film.
"Instead of a story I hope it just has a gay, black, female character to make me feel bad about being a white male, that’s my favourite genre."
I grew up loving Jurassic Park now I get to see my daughter experience the same magic of the old and new movies.
🦖
Hollywood using Nostalgia bringing old actors back in to SUCKER you all to a bad anti-climatic movie
Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin
im in love with daisy the girl little one human
Didn't the two doctors got married?i remember one of their kids got distracted with Barney the dinosaur
ONLY 11 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
blues child got kidnapped? idk
Dam new movie
Dam
BLUE HAS A KID NOW
"i saw parasuar, Deinonychus, quetzal, allosaurus, Triceratops, Rex, Mosasaurus, Therizinosaurus, Raptor and hopefully that last big thing is Giganotosaurus... hahahhaha knowledge from playing Ark.."
Welp this trailer is practically the whole movie…might as well just wait when it streams.
"Unlike the previous movies, I hope they will bring bigger guns this time rather than relying on .22 rifles when facing dinosaurs..🤣😂🤣😂"
so magic is all that is missing to make it a fantasy world.
Blueeeee babyyyyyyy❤
Just put this movie series to rest once and for all... Should've left it after the 2nd OG one.
Ugh should’ve flipped the switch in the 2nd movie and killed them all
"The fact they are bringing in dinos with feathers makes me happy, we discovered the feathers in the late 90s and now scientists think most of them had feathers. Amazing to see them adapt to the scientific discoveries where the first couple movies just didn’t know about them yet"
as a Jurassic world fan
Very excited! I love the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movies!
Hollywood just turned this franchise from Si-Fi into Cowboy/Pets love story...
So how did Blue have a baby if all the raptors were female? Who the hell is the father?
When will it relese
the old charaters are back alan an ian are back guys
"They seem to be doing this with all of the classic films from the 80s/90s. Other recent examples being The Terminator, Matrix and Star Wars. i.e They're taking these great films from the past, and bringing the original actors back because they know that it will play to people's nostalgia. For me personally, it's actually quite annoying because these newer films will never be anywhere near as good as the original movies( we all know that) and I think it's just a money making scheme whilst also showing a lack of creativity and originality with the modern film industry."
Don't Congratulate me coz my channel has not reched yet as my channel name
"Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day Read more:"
"I'm here to check the views, who else?"
The cast 👏🏼⭐️⭐️
Don't worry guy's Mario knows how to team up with Dinos
Dudes are playing ark solvival  real life
"Imagine the franchise ending with Zack, Grey, Timmy and Lex all teaming up to open a museum about all of this. And Eric’s working there too."
Iam exited to see the movie
This  is my favourite movie
Were gona wath the movie at the cinema 10 june ticeks reddy planed
Is that a mortem rex?
ONLY 12 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Seriously when are they going to let this go 🤦🏻‍♂️
What other proofs can we give these evolusionist that human co existed with dinosaurs. And dinosaurs where not as many as this when they were had not extint. Must this people keep misleading others with lies that they don't want to admit to. Great movie but don't use it as history lesson.
Mosaaaaa
it’s really sad that this is gonna be the last jurassic movie. Hopefully they go out with a masterpiece and do the franchise the justice it deserves
1:57 I ALWAYS COME BACK
Bird is the word
"Ooohhh I can't wait to be preached to by Jeff Goldblum again! /sarc off 
P.S. The dinosaurs in cold weather thing looks awfully dumb."
WE FINALY GET TO SEE BABY BLUE IN MOST OF THE MOVIE INSTEAD OF JSUT A LITTLE VIDEO!!! But dam this movie looks sick! It’s cool how we get to see the little kid Owen and Clair adopted as a teenager and how are two favourite characters from Jurassic park and Jurassic world Alan grant and Owen Grady finally meet
"I’ve been
 a fan for years and this looks so good for the end movie love that it’s more realistic with the feathers"
"If Spinosaurus appears in the movie, it could help Blue and Rexy fight the Giganotosaurus."
“Don’t move.” I don’t think it would work with a Giganotosaurus.
I was born after Jurassic Park was released in theaters. I was around when the next ones were released but I was really young when the second and third were released so I didn’t see them in theaters. I got to watch the fourth and fifth in theaters and I plan to do the same with this one.
People do coexist with dinosaurs today. Crocodilians are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs.
There should be a movie series like this with prehistoric mammals
"It’s nice to see Alan, Ellie and Dr Malcolm all together in the same movie again. They haven’t been since the first. If only we could see Lex and Tim again in the movie too. They haven’t been seen since the second."
Is the Dilophosaurus in this movie an adult?
Baby blue 💙
I cannot wait for this. The first was released just after my first son was born and I still love them 29 years on
Women suck at acting in action movies. Expect for a few
The new Mario movie trailer looks spectacular!
"They did Blue’s baby as a reference to the Jurassic Park film (1993)! Where Grant discovered how the dinosaurs were breeding on Nublar. Although, how she did it without a partner, is kinda of a plot hole, but I like they tried something new with it."
I was praying we'd get the trio back! Tbh Chris Pratt and Bryce will be getting in the way of the classic characters:)

This looks terrible
That fucking kid doomed them all.....
Looks like one hell of a nightmare lol
ONLY 13 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
I will give credit from thise video I wont this video
Surprised Billy isnt gonna be back. Nivola seems to be getting popular again randomly.
is it Alan Grant from Jurassic Park 1997? 😱
Ah yes dinosaurs well known for dwelling in cold environments.
"Owen: “I always come back”
Me:”your not spring trap”"
1:51 That pyroraptor sounds badass
I like the red hair girl. I want to marry her.
OMG
Although I’ve never watched the jp movies except for jp 3 but I bet this would be nostalgic to fans
Gonna be epic!
this is the best part of jurassic and best movie of the year
Can a T-rex be tamed and can you pet it?
1:57 *i always come back*
Dont know but i guess that that some part of music of this trailer is similar to Zack Snyders trailer🤔🤔
Only Dom and the power of family can save them now
Spoiler - Giganotosaurs will badly beat rexy and in the time it's gonna kill her Spinosaurs attacks Giga and teams up with rexy. Both Takes down Giganotosaurs together.
Amazing. Alan Grant back again. I grew up watching the original movie I’ve probably watched it over 100 times as a kid. Damn seeing him makes me feel old now!!
Goofy ahh movie
ONLY 14 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
How can reptiles exist in a frozen place ?
more mosasaurus plss
"fok ya,  made in houdini.."
I NEED TO SEE THIS
Taking my kids to see this June 10th .my son is so excited 😆
0:26 holy shit i love that sound so much i literally came here just to hear it again after seeing the trailer in theaters a few times. could not care less about the rest of the trailer or the movie. i just VERY MUCH like that sound. in the theater with it being loud my GOD its good
"Remember, just have fun with these dinosaur movies kids, (aka adult skeptics like myself) lol. Don't let little things like the apparent EASE of roping extremely powerful animals like their cattle and holding them with same said ropes. Their slightest twitch could dislocate your limbs. OR = Letting the raptor Blue into the modern World go so it could potentially eat someone's baby or worse. Running around the jungle in high heels for hours on end, lol. Yeah, just have fun with it kids. It's only a series of movies, lol. A very logical one, ;)"
I cannot wait to see this!!!
"Only dumb asses believe the so-called ""science"" behind these movies which are nothing but secular propaganda."
Can't wait to see it
I have a feeling that most of this will be played up for a gag. Like the Baryonyx was in Fallen Kingdom. A lot of people waited a long time to see that creature and it was played up for a lame joke with Franklin shrieking like a woman. I think that's going to happen here. The Giganotosaurus will be played up for a gag. The Quetzacoatlus and Pyroraptor? Definitely going to be a throwaway joke. I hope I am wrong but these 2 trailers seem to be following that trend.
Shoutout to the dinosaur trainers who got these dinosaurs trained for the movie!
I'm ready for Jurassic world 3
Where are the feathers? All this time and you still cannot put feathers on them?
prehistoric planet is much better and accurate than this movie
All the OG main characters are back! :O
"This is laughable, and an utter waste of time and money, watching this useless garbage."
why the heck is there a horse with the dinosaurs lmao 1:28
Same shit different title.  These movies get more dumb.  Every movie humans have some stupid mission where Dinos attack everyone.  Its old!  Time to put thinking caps on and make something new/original.  This is one of those movies that never should have went past the lost world.   Every movie after is DUMB!
ONLY 15 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Must see in theatre
"*Btw, DONT even need to watch the trailer, as just the ""Thumbnail"" alone is enough to make ANY original fan of the original JP movies either laugh hysterically or just feel sick & vomit. Either way, Chris Pratt + Jurassic Park = NOT EVEN CLOSE TO Jurassic Park! From just 2 mins of Pratt on screen & ANY original fan could instantly see they havent made a Jurassic Park movie in YEARS, instead, Chris Pratt stars in the most stupidly written ""Teenage Drama"" with Dinosaurs thrown in. IF you like the newer Jurassic Park ""Franchise"" (NOT movies, its Franchise money making garbage for the dumbest people ever, full stop.*"
"*OMFG.... Nobody I know can understand HOW insanely & terrifyingly SIMPLE or ""almost"" braindead ANY living creature would HAVE to be to not just watch a pointless, Money over matter, WORST of the worst movie possible, but to somehow like it too?!? then we are ALL screwed!! Not only has Jurassic Park become the BIGGEST JOKE of a movie series, but now?? It's NOTHING but a ""Story/writing does NOT matter, just make ANYTHING & morons will love it, ""Franchise"". & Chris Pratt? USED to seem nice, cute, but now? He's the BIGGEST try-hard, ALWAYS ""pouting his lips"" poser possible. This shit's EMBARRASSING.*"
Such heart beating moments and nostalgia. Whatever they create are still good
"if you put ur trust and faith in Jesus and beleive He died for ur sins and repent from your sins,you will be saved from hell and go to Heaven,being a good person wont get u into Heaven,only Jesus can save you.hell is so bad i want to see all y’all in Heaven,hell is never ending suffering,while Heaven is never ending peace.pls accept this message."
This is the new fast and furious style series. Too many movies…soon the dinosaurs will be in space by Jurassic Park 9
"1:57

William afton : YOU COPIED MY LINE!"
"Sorry, it's really a lot of suspension of disbelief thinking that a bunch of dinosaurs can walk so freely in america withouth them being shotted at.

And no, this isn't to do with yesterday's sad events."
I’ve been in love in Dinosaurs ever since I was a baby
"Looks like a CGIfest. There should be more to a modern movie than just CGI, 'splosions, action, and destruction. What happened to good story telling and anticipation buildup?"
Whack.
This looks so dumb that it actually makes me want to see it!
ONLY 16 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
ich hab den trailer schon beim ersten mal gehasst - gut gemacht aber völlig unrealistisch wie jurassic parc teile denn die würden in unserer dreckigen welt nicht überleben
More than one new Dino’s are you kidding me
This looks like Jurassic Park: Infinity War
101K HITS TO GO
Nostalgia
OMG every time I see this everywhere goosebumps I can't wait when the movie comes out
I can't wait for it to come out....best movie franchise ever!!!!!
"I really hope it is the last movie. Im so tried of ""its the end of humanity"" BS. The only dinos that would escape humans hunting them to death are the fish ones. If we can't kill the adults we can damn well kill all the eggs and new borns"
Eye $till mi$$ 1993-? Schindler's List https://youtu.be/5d9NO8RwBHg much better than the entire 1993-? Jura$$ic Franchi$e dunno wai for $ome rea$un$
They need a fat guy in this movie that gets eaten by a dinosaur
"(esto parece SPAM, pero es necesario dejar claro esto a quien le llegue) si la pedofilia es la perdida del instinto partenal en hombres hacia mujeres menores de edad e incluso niñas, y en mujeres es la perdida del instinto materno cuando su atraccion esta fijada en niños pequeños, es ilegal, inmoral, incorrecto, y aunque duele que sea valido en casos extremos de malestar (porque no hay otra opcion visible), es mejor no alimentar eso. Desde esta misma analogia, la persona que fue zoofilico, es practicamente la perdida de la aptitud y capacidad reproductoria de ese humano o humana, y ambas cosas estan mal, Mejoren sus conductas, aprendan de la ciencia, el daño es irreversible, pero puede reconstruirse solo si aprende a gestionarse bien como persona, sera funcional, esto va tanto para personas que han sido victimas como para victimarios (los cuales deberian ser creativos y buscar una solucion ingeniosa que no implique lastimar a otr@)"
rawr... prrrr
ooo seeing the carno and allo together like dat ;o;
So these people never learn huh
Looks like stupid shit
That last t rex is not main one...i think its from isla Sorna
Let's add black women it should be better
That's going to be a good one i can't wait to see it..
I don't think they're ever going to end this series.
"“I always come back”

Wait a damn minute—"
This trailer is so much better.
Epic
Omg can't wait for this love Jurassic park
Love
"DISFRUTALO AHORA CON TODO!
TRAILER OFICIAL AUDIO ESPAÑOL LATINO: https://youtu.be/ZwSwm7xaamY"
"Seems like a decent action flick, judging by this trailer.

Dont care about it, really.

I only cared about the ones from 1 to 3 and that was the end of it for me."
CHILLS ABSOLUTE CHILLS MY CHILDHOOD ELLIE AND GRANT BACK TOGETHER
I can't wait for this to come out
This seems to have themes as Crichton envisioned when inspired by Mary Shelley.
ONLY 17 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
The fact that the original cast is gonna be in it for the awesome conclusion is just next level. They did it in a way that doesn’t make me feel old and I’m ok with that lol!!
❤️✨😭
Starlord
"I want that Laura Dern moment where she goes "" god damnnn youuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" 🤩🤩🤩"
Finally !!!!! I've been waiting for them 3 !!! i'm a huge fan of jurassic park !!! Definitely going to watch !!!!!
"https://youtu.be/iaLx0c3D6EY
Take a look at my first Jurassic Park in Arizona!"
I have been waiting for this!!!
"They're saying it's a ""conclusion"", i really want to see this series never ending!"
The 3 OG actos look so fucked up. 😂
"If North Korea launches a nuclear bomb, we'll be like the dinosaurs 🦕"
"Unless we are in moon,mars"
"There coming back when end world come here ,is going to be new Earth new people"
This is the best movie ever this is one of the only good movies still around every one of these movies become a classic. We need more thrilling movies like this it’s just something about adventure and survival movies they are the best
My godness greacious ive been watching this trailer over a 20 times now i love it to much!
Owen just said “I ALWAYS COME BACK” is that a William Afton speech
For once zombies and aliens aren't the ones taking over
"Can a ""dance off"" fix things? They have a ""Star-Lord"" but obviously not enough. Obviously, before our world ever makes dinosaurs, humans first need to make a JARVIS, with an Iron Legion, or at least super-soldiers."
The old and new united for another master piece.
Very cool but its kinda ironic that all those dinos can live in the snow while they extincted because the earth cooled down in reallife xD
Where is the Spinosaurus?
Cant believe how far we have gone from 1993-2022 we the OG cast
ONLY 18 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
The trailer is so cool
game call the isle  if u  watch  movies  you play the game it awsome
Jurassic world is best movie 🦖🦖🦖🦕🦕🦕
* goes on Amazon to purchase vintage Jurassic Park teeshirt *
"OMG!!!!!! I can’t wait for this
Summer! 💕🦖🦕"
Fuck this
*WE WANT THE SPINOSAURUS!!! 🦖+⛵*
1:57 the man behind the slaughter
I was OBSESSED with Jurassic Park and Dino’s since I was a kid and that wonder and excitement was just refueled by this trailer! Cannot WAIT to see this
dam really every dinosaur from ark survival evolved in in this move dam
Jai Sudigali Sudheer!
How many Ark fanboys’ have a massive chubby right now?
Okay they brought OG’s back ! This gonna so awesome
I wish Elasmosaurus and Ichthyosaurus were going to be in the movie
"I am so happy that they're bringing back  Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum and Lauren Dern from the Jurassic Park movie😎😎😉👍👍 in 1993 ! Can't wait to see this new movie in theater of Jurassic World Domination Kingdom !!! I have seen Jurassic World and Jurassic World  Fallen Kingdom with Chris Platt !! Chris Pratt is a great actor in the Jurassic World movies!! Great actors and actresses in this film😍😍😉👍😎🎶🎵🎶 I love the line that Sam Neil said in the  movie ""Nobody move a muscle""!"
BINOD
It would be nice to see Liopleurodon
I feel daft but for so long i thought this was called Jurassic World Domination...not Dominion 🤔 I mean for months.
I've always loved dinosaurs and want to learn more and more about them
All because a little girl pressed a button
I didn't know mario was in jurassic world
Baby blue💙
As soon as John started talking i got chills
Pretty sure the US Army can annihilate a group of big reptiles
ONLY 19 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
AYO ITS HAPPPPPENING SHITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN
"AAAAAAHH
YES LET'S GOOOOOO"
Can't wait for this
CANT WAIT WATCH IN CINEMA :D :P
We are looking forward to seeing Dominion 😊 we have the rest of the Jurassic Park movies as well
Pretty good to see Doctor Grant back!
I hope this movie is the one where Blue and Owen finally have a tender moment — when Blue FINALLY lets Owen touch her and there would be a moment where she nuzzles into his hand as an open act of affection. It would be sad if it happened as a final goodbye or something.
dinosaurs are back
I’m here for Neil and Laura ❤️❤️❤️
is this blue?i love blue.
"Alan Grant, a THERIZINOSAUR, and Chris Pratt all in the same movie will be absolutely GREAT! I have just watched the original movies, and I am excited to see how good this is."
I'm asking all of you a question is Jurassic world Dominion the last Jurassic movie of the franchise or not
I wish the kids from the first movie would have been in the last one
I would love to see Protoceratops
I would love to see Carcharodontosaurus
they made another one?? Damn they r milking tf out of this series
"dinosaur, grrrrr :D"
"That Tickle-Chicken scene is terrifying. I am so excited for this movie. Jurassic Park is still one of the best films ever made, and stands its ground against the test of time."
WoW trop coooooooool
"Director: “How on earth do we still make these Dino movies interesting… I mean, the plot is always the same” 

Assistant: “So like, you know Taken.. with Liam Neeson?” 

Director: “Yeah.. and?”

Assistant: “Hear me out for a sec…”"
All my life I've loved dinosaurs since I was a kid and I've Sean every Jurassic park and evolution move till now so I'm going to hopefully see this move
After the first two movies everything went south.
Gotta keep the Dinosaur lie going..............
"I,m so hyped for this !!!"
ONLY 20 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"Le epic jeff goldbloom monologue trailer

Man I'm hype for this movie"
This just looks like no way home but with dinosaurs and i want it NOW TAKE MY MOTHERFUCKING MONEY 💰
"Got my tickets, I’m ready!"
I liked this trailer but then when the mosasaurus came I was so excited and I got goosebumps seeing the original cast
It’s nice to see that Dilophosaurus is going to be in the movie. It hasn’t been in any of the movies since the first one.
How did Blue get a baby?
Will Ceratosaurus be in it?
I would love to see Baryonyx again
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I am a big fan of Jurassic world....and seeing Jurassic world domenion
just give me more happiness than ever"
Cant wait 😁😄🇸🇪
ONLY 21 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"Next thing you know, there is gonna be a prequel trilogy.

But anyways, this looks like something I will enjoy, might have to watch it!"
Wow really hope the little clone girl who let all the dinosaurs free in Fallen Kingdom got eaten by one.
I would like to see Jurassic park become more like Ark Survival. Where people are riding and taming dinos with some future tech thrown in. It's a natural progression.
Hold up! So some kid decides to let these guys free and then the whole world goes to sh*t? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ark players know 90% of those dinos
I’m excited to see the old cast of original Jurassic Park movies they were good characters
"Chases running on roof tops and the ground, in a vehicle, in the  air. That's it?
Ok, got it."
"I watched Jurassic park for the park version of it, the latest sequels have become so materialised, so urban. Bring the dinosaurs back in the jungle!"
1:57 william afton moment
Walter white should be on this blue crystal meth
Finally the giga getting some screen time in a movie
there is a reason why dinosaurus are extinct because of comet that hit earth
SOO EXICITEDDDD😍
This movie showed us the whole movie
First three were really close to my heart!!
ONLY 22 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Super
Sweet... So excited
Dam that looks cool
"No hate, but Spider Kid is better."
They feathered the raptors! It's about time
"I really hope they bring back spinosaurus.
They always end up going with T-Rex all the time but in my opinion spinosaurus is way more badass. Largest land carnivore to ever exist."
BLOCKBUSTER🙌💖🙌
me and my freind bought tickets to see this and the batman a good year
I can't wait to watch this on payday
They dragged poor Sam Neil into this didn’t they…
So crazy that after 30 years the quality of the dinos look the same. 1993 was way ahead of its time.
I mean like a couple of guys with rpgs and dominion is back right?
They're alive like me?! How's that working out for you and the rest of humanity? XD XD XD
Sam Neil’s accent though…..why has he gone so American when in the film it was his natural new Zealand accent. Very very  bad
Have a feeling the pandemic has massively affected the production of this film in a very bad way.
I have a suspicion he won't be coming back.
At 0:27 - best part “oooooooUUUUUWWWAHHHHHHH”
God I can't wait!!!!!!! You guys went all out for this.
"The change to portraying the dinosaurs as monsters rather than animals is the biggest transgression of the sequels as it fundamentally changed the audience's point of view. In JP1 & 2 you're not privy to anything the characters aren't; you're going through the experience WITH them. That's a deliberate, important creative decision by Spielberg. From JP3 onwards you're on the side of the ""puppeteers"", to use a timely comparison. You're now (as a viewer) more omniscient, instead of sympathetic. Criminal."
ONLY 23 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"Old dinosaurs, NEW dinosaurs, old actors, new actors! I'm sooo excited for this movie!"
I really like the Giganotosaurus.
"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. (James 4:8)
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)"
"Got the mandatory Black female in it, I see"
Please let me know when the film will be released
Holy fucking dinosaur shit. This looks incredible. Finally a movie worth going to the movies for again.
This one's for John Hammond.
yall realized that the cgi giga has those extra spikes on its back but the animatronic giga doesn’t lol
finally ... I've been longing for this
are we just going to ignore hammond's speech in the beginning?
I will definetly watch this in theatre🇮🇳
Looks shit
After the disaster of a second installment of JW I dont have high hopes for this one.
yo i swear to god beta is the cutest thing ever
"""Don't move"". It is amazing. I have all movies. After pandemic it is the first time that I will go to the theater."
ONLY 24 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
I am excited for this movie but I am waiting to see
"This is a perfect example of how good Independence Day 2 could have been. Instead they decided not to pay Will Smith and add ""gay"" scenes. Damn shame."
My fav movie series ever... I'm watching this since my childhood....and now I'm 19 but always waitin for jurassic series desperately.....thankyou guys❣️
I wonder if the Spinosours is gonna be in this too!!
"The new Uncharted movie, starring Burt Macklin."
"EEEEK, THIS LOOKS SO GOOD AND AWESOME, BUT THE BEST PART IS ITS RIGHT AFTER MY BDAY"
"I think it looks good. CG or not, I could care less. I'll be taking my kids to see it. Gave me goosebumps lol."
why they had to use a black woman? 2:09. another sjw movie.
Please come JW4
They should do what marvel just does and stick them on a island thousands of miles from the nearest civilization
#waiting

Baby blue🥺
Seriously can't wait
"I don't know if its cinematic technology but Sam Neill and Laura Dern look great! They practically look the same as when I was a kid. And obviously Jeff Goldblum aged like fine wine. 

It would be cool if they referenced Dr. Alan Grant as ""The Dinosaur Man"" just like the kid in Jurassic Park 3."
Palaeontologists Assemble!
I always route for the dinosaurs 🦕 💕😊
Cara que filme amei demais :)
So excited to see how this movie will play out.  Excited because they are bringing in 3 original cast members from the beginning Jurassic Park era to the now Jurassic Park era!  Not sure if these go along the lines of Micheal Crichton's novels.  I'm very excited for the action and seeing the original and the new cast members come together!
My most anticipated flim ever! i can't wait for this to come out. I am a huge jurassic fan.
How many members waiting this awesome picture 😊😊😊😊😍😍😍

What an epic shit
"Claire:come back
Chris pratt: **becoming full purple guy**I always come back"
"*Now what John Hammond and InGen did at Jurassic Park is create genetically engineered theme park monsters, nothing more and nothing less*"
Anger with Chris hasn't subside since infinity
Steel ball run universe looks great
Okay how does blue have a kid
Not a single one of these movies were ever a disappointment. Every single Jurassic park/world was a hit !
That moment when you can enjoy movies again
"Those who have not received Yeshua Almighty Yeshua as  Saviour, this is for you:.

The door of salvation is open now for you today, all you have to do is REPENT of YOUR sins, and turn from your  sinful life style that displeases Almighty Yeshua  and received the gift of the Holy Spirit, and your name will be written in the book of life in heaven. Yeshua love you, and  He forgive you of your sins, He is merciful and His love endure for ever. Today is a new day and all you have to do is open your heart to Him , Don""t let another day go by with out Yeshua Almighty YAHUAH as your Lord and Savior.

Don't wait another day, Yeshua bless you all 🙏"

"What is up with those hollywood trailers, that look like they are fan made, recently? Is it just someones nephew whose making all of those or what is going on?"
1:57 at this time the iconic 'I always come back' voice line by William Afton came back
"It will be enjoyable 
Here in my country am actor too but my dream is to play in Hollywood"
They really need to stop and I’m sorry but I know Bryce Dallas Howard is Ron Howard’s daughter but the nepotism is so over the top
Jesus Christ loves you all and died for your sins please repent and turn to Christ before it’s too late ⏰
"call me crazy, but i don’t think cold blooded reptiles can live in the snowy tundra"

"Dinosaurs in Valletta, Malta... This I gotta see."
Do you think a 4 year old can watch this ?
"Ngl, this looks good"
They should add the Dilophosaurus back in because Because I am and never been in a movie only in Jurassic Park.
that sound from 0:27 is divine!!! UGH
"Even though the first movie was disappointing and the second movie was unwatchable, I still went into the trailer with some hope that seeing the old characters would make it better. It didn't. This still looks like a mess without a story or direction. The franchise has been dead since Lost World"

"Life will find a way, the way it hit in the first part of JP, it's still the same"
Why do they always have to go bigger? Because you ALWAYS go BIG OR GO HOME!!! Also I'm going 3D
"After watching Fallen Kingdom, I have no hope for this... I guess the only good thing we are getting are the OG actors."
"OMG, I am soooo excited about this movie with the nostalgic cast, it’s gonna be AWESOME. Already bought tickets for these."
Everyone hit that like button!
"when you look at this, beeing courageous and a hero doesnt mean anything anymore... they all look brave like Ian Malcolm or Alan Grant, no matter who they are, even women and kids... Zero credibility. Is it possible that Jurassic World will become a Woke movie and that the franchise will be destroyed like all of the other franchises in 2022 Hollywood ? We will see in 1 month if this classic franchise will die because of wokism. I hate 2022 USA."
2:30 that dinosaur killed a fat man in the past.
2:34 don’t move bigger why do they always have to go bigger
Grant is back! Yes so excited
I really like the jurassic park sequels having been a fan of the originals aa a kid. They did sequels right respecting the source material and giving the new generation and old fans movies to love.
MY FRIENDS WONNNNTTTTTTTTTTTT

Pin
i like
"long time HUGE fan of the jurassic series since i was 8-9 years old! so nostalgic to see some of the old cast back, along with more dinosaurs! cannot WAIT for this movie!"
Creation is an act of sheer will
To see almost all the old characters together with the new ones makes you feel nostalgic. Hope the movie will be good
you just had to turn a great movie and idea into this fast and furious level garbage
looks so goooood
Holy shit the original cast !!!!! I am so ready for this movie .
🤩
Better name:jurassic world:domination
I will always be a fan of the Jurassic movies no matter how far fetched they get. Watching them takes you back to a kid....
Absolutely amazing can we please find a way to  To include titana boa that would be nice  Freaking awesome!!
"ngl looks boring to me and i'm a fan.

"I'm so excited for this movie!

When I was very little my parents had me watch the first Jurassic Park and I was OBSESSED. I didn't even cry when the characters got eaten but I cried when the T-Rex was chewing the tire off the car (?). This series has been very special to me for nearly all of my life.

Can't wait to see it :)"
ONLY 33 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
mantap zhaf
i now whos blues. kid. father is. its indoraptor
dinos living in the snow?
Someone made dinosaur sounds without ever hearing them 🤔
Trash!
I wasn’t looking forward to this…. but since the old cast is back and they’ve finally decided to conclude the series… I’ll look forward to it now.
"I remember when the original came out in the early nineties and how it wowed us how real the dinosaurs looked. These once look fake. I'm guessing, they're using fewer models and only CGI instead."
I love the movie jerrasic park its my fav show. Btw i am a girl and i love dinos.
Might actually pay theater prices to see this on the big screen. Fun!!
Waiting for part 6 eagerly
Snow dinosaurs?  Pass
shit movie
after 29 years of first Jurassic park we will see all original cast once again isn't that amazing! the movie who created technological breakthrough at the time is going to me memorizing experience for everyone.
I can't wait
Whose waiting for this movie
ONLY 34 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Looks awful. Full of dumb clichés.
"I Will watching, i must watching!!! I missed blue!!!!"
"'
oh no...
stop watch this lousy movie video at 012"
🤤I🤤can't 🤤wait 🤤🤤🤗😶🤗😌🙌🏾🙏🏽👀
I mean it's a dinosaur movie so there's no point if you can't suspend your disbelief. But seriously we would literally be on a mass scale conscripting anyone who could hold a weapon to kill as many of especially the predators as possible. We would have wild hog hunts with thermal scopes from helicopters but for raptors.
Icant wait for this
"Even as someone who thoroughly enjoys the wondrous idea of animals communicating with humans who has a huge tolerance and capacity for forgiveness of crap movies  being made…this Jurassic park movie looks like the stupidest one yet. Just so stupid… The last one was really bad, but they have Starlord making promises to his dinosaur in this….what the fuck? Stop letting Colon Trevorrow make movies.

I read this would be the end of the Jurrasic Park franchise. That’s terrible and understood but I wish it was just the end of letting Colin Trevorrow have control over this world. Each one of these movies have been bad, all they had going for them was the franchise and cast. Trevorrow has been allowed to ruin this franchise and Star Wars. He probably licks Hollywood suit butthole to be continually given the free reign to destroy simple and enjoyable concepts. I hope Disney buys the Jurassic Park franchise and doesn’t let Colon Trevorrow shit all over any more classic characters. I mean he’s really bad at this please stop him. If Disney already owns this then shame on them too. Come one man the military dinosaurs was stupid, now you top it with the most unbelievable trope ever!? Fuck Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly. Are you kidding me though????? This looks like a shitty retelling of Jurassic Park 3. These guys continue to make crap while being set up for success."
Malcom: “Bigger. Why do they always have to go bigger?”
30 years back to my memories 🦖🦕🦖🦕🦖🦕🦕🦕🦖
"Why do the dinosaurs look so shitty? Its 2022, why can't they get CGI that looks good????"
1:49 they finally got it right.
I guess weapons and military in general don’t exist anymore and all dinosaurs are breeding like rabbits . Still gonna watch it tho :D
Wowwww we getting the old cast bet
Looks wicked. Can't wait to see it Universal Pictures.
Can't freaking wait

Giganotosaurus??
😆😆😆 SO PUMPED!!! 💓💓💓
the dinosaur am excited about only is this 1:48 lol
Legends is coming respect 👏
Dude The Jurassic world franchise always comes with the best trailers.
"I hope Jurassic World: Dominion redeems the Jurassic Franchise. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’s Trailers made the movie looked so good and hype. But when I watched the movie for the first time, I was greatly disappointed. Some of the characters seemed to be jokers more than they were in Jurassic World. Also, some of the characters were lacking character development, and the storyline was nothing new. But don’t get me wrong, I’m happy that they made more animatronic dinosaurs for Fallen Kingdom. But when I compare Fallen Kingdom to Jurassic Park, I thought, “Damn, Fallen Kingdom doesn’t seem like a Jurassic movie”. Fallen Kingdom is an okay movie, but I hope that Dominion redeems this franchise for good."
Miss you Irrfan khan
OMG bruh the nostalgia😁. I can’t wait to see it!!!!!!!!
Can't wait!! Can't wait!! Can't wait!! 😭😭
No way home: Jurassic park edition
Holy man i never thought i would see alan grant again
Where is Norman??
ONLY 36 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"The galimimus scene from the original Jurassic Park looked more realistic than Parasarolophus in the opening scene of this trailer. Its 30 years folks, 30 years."
"Claire: humans and dinosaurs can’t coexist.

Birds: Am I a joke to you?"
02:29 this was creepy if I was there personally.
"I’m sorry, but this looks so bad"
This is Epic this is Jurassic Park and world all together even with Owen Clara and old Alain Ellie And Ian
i like this
I really hope the black lady is Jeff's daughter from Jurassic Park 2
From 1993 to 2022 I’m so excited for this movie and to see baby blue is so awesome blue is my favorite dinosaur in the franchise. It’s sad it’s the final one but it’s been one hell of a ride.
"Starlord,  when u know u fucked up,  its time to ask thor's help... ☺"
"Now the question a lot of people are wondering 
Will their be a spinosaur"
can somebody post the piano sheet for this trailer pls ;-;
Jurassic Park changed who I am. If they can't keep the current issues and metaphors out of this I will create dinosaurs and set em loose in LA. I mean maybe a metaphor or two.
How can I get facial hair shaped like Chris Pratt here ?
I cant wait WOOF WOOF
"Creation is a act of sheer will, life will find a way. What remarkable words is that."

"This Trailer music ...
🤔Same to Justice League Jack Snyder cut trailer"
what would be awsome is if they had a double hybrid dinosaur. Part Indominus Rex and part Indoraptor.
damn this movie is kinda exciting ngl
Damn Ark 2 looks decent asf! 🤣
Truly excited for this movie💯❤
ONLY 37 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
Amazing
"Woah... I'm 5 years old when i watched the Jurassic world, i'm already 12 now... TIME FLIES SO FAST."
Laura Dern still looks as 🔥 as i remember her in the first Jurassic Park in 93 and great they are all together with the new ones Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would have liked to have seen Julianne Moore back as well but hey will settle for these legends back again 👍🏻
"Aah, the pure magic of cinema content. 
Really smart of them to bring the original cast back, adding extra value for my box office dollar!!!

We can only hope their acting don't outshine the computer generated dinosaurs, which as far as I'm concerned are the real stars of the show. I'd go so far as to say this wonderful franchise couldn't exist without them.

So here's to you, Universal and your official trailer. If I wasn't aware of Jurassic Park Dominions before, I certainly am now! Hip hip!"
The original cast has returned. Thats so sick. I cant wait for this next month!
"Sam Neill (plays Alan Grant) is now 5 years older than Richard Attenborough (played John Hammond) was during Jurassic Park.

Now you feel old."
Sam Neil is back!!
The giant Utah raptor is sick
Bro it’s crazy cause I was hoping Dr.grant came back somehow after all these years .
Life will find away is a goldblum quote
Yes we can .we have done it before and we can do it again.
And a spino
Just one more trailer
This is going to be awesome!
I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
Mommy
"Well, now i will know how Jurassic Park fans felt when they found out Jurassic park 3 is the last movie...
Now it's time to end another great Saga, probably one of the best Dinosaur movies out there.
But everything that is good, has to come to an end..."
0:38 looks like when the spino did that in jp3
Alan grants back
This honestly look like it might be better than all the previous Jurassic parks even my favorite Jurassic’s park 3
Yo this the first trailer I seen in a while that did the movie justice
Look it's mario
ngomong ape
ONLY 38 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"no words , wonderful Jurassic park ...."
"Just when i was thinking I wasn't gonna watch this piece of shit movie and was about to close the video I saw Laura Dern and  Sam Neill 
Damn you universal, now I gotta watch this movie😂😂😂😂
And it better be a good one"
The awesome  power of nature
Bring the spinasours man
"so cool, I'm really looking forward to it"
i hope no one dies...
Wow
"Ian Malcom: “bigger. why do they always have to go bigger?”

*flashback to 2001*

Paul Kirby: “what was that?”

Billy: “it’s a Tyrannosaurus”

Alan Grant: “i don’t think so, sounds bigger”"
🦖🦖🦖🦖🦖🐊🐊
I can't wait to see this movie I love Jurassic world than all of its movies and they make a sequel no I'm very happy
"The dinosaurs could never take the world back if we all had assault rifles. They don't even have to be full auto. I'd be more worried about lions dominating the world. Sure, you against a lion unarmed? Good luck. But that's not how the world works anymore. I want to see the dinosaurs vs the Sopranos movie. As long as we're already doing CGI we might as well make a Tony Soprano fights a T rex in an Iron Man suit movie. The movie should be called Tony Soprano puts on an Iron Man Suit and Fights a T Rex for an Hour and a Half. I'd watch that at least once."
1:57 Fnaf reference?
B
cool but stupid
"Ahhhhhhhhhhh did I see Jeff goldblum?????? Yessssssssss omg I can't wait to I stream this shit here!!!!!

I'ma get my snacks, get real comfy, sho a lil Wendy Williams thigh, and ask

THE RAPTOR GOT FEATHERSSSSSS
I feel like they put a small piece of every movie from the whole franchise into this one. Can't wait.
YES!! SAM NEiLL iS BACK!!
"I remember seeing the first Jurassic park when I was 7,  Richard Attenborough was always my favorite actor, and to bring back the original, cast to be in the last movie is amazing. I remember the day Richard Attenborough died in real life, I was heart broken. To hear him as John Hammond from the first movie, at the beginning, made my day, and my heart warm up!!! I am stoked, they also brought back the dilophosaurus which has not been an actual dinosaur sense the first film when Nedry died!"
The 1.3 billion Chinese will simply eat them back to extinction.
"I would love a remake of the books, that is more accurate. Like on Netflix. Especially the Lost World, I feel while the current movies are entertaining they lost the plot a while ago."
This series can't have a final/last movie
"i have been the biggest Jurassic world fan for YEARS im talking around 6+ yrs, i literally had multiple Jurassic posters AND figurines in my room, sadly i lost them when i moved. ANYWAYS i am so.. FUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YRS TO WATCH IT, SO HURRY UP. >:("
disney eat your heart out real action here !!!!
I know this might sound emotional but I remember playing the first Jurassic park on my Gameboy on the way to toy's r us to buy Christmas presents! To keep this franchise alive brings so much happiness to me! 🙂
"LOL  if dinosuar mad just put your hand up like ""stop"" this dude does it im sure it works oh yea dont forget the motorcycles the bane of all raptors"
From 0:14 to 0:30 it reminds me of the Zack Snyder's justice league trailer music 🔥❤️
"This looks cool, nostalgic and beautiful"
Hey does anybody notice starting music of the trailer looks like zack snyder justice league trailer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.....
This is the old trailer
"You aren't going to flip a big ship with the weight of a mosa, much less from that crane arm(the arm would just tear off). The mosa was as far as we know only 60ft max long, and 30k lbs. A large commercial crab fishing boat is in excess of 100' long, and well over 100 gross tonnage, with a ballast around 30% of it's gross, that vessel in the video, most likely a  60 ton ballast....it's not gonna roll. Everything about the original jurassic park is perfectly plausible, it doesn't stretch anything so as to break your immersion by constantly pricking your subconscious with stuff that doesn't make sense. I don't think most people talking about nostalgia in these comments, realize how flawlessly written both the jurassic park book, and the screenplay of the first movie, really was, and how the subsequent films don't hold a candle to it."
I always come back💀
Wow this looks like an amazing fun incredible hot mess and I can’t wait to see it 😁
ONLY 40 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"Come back

I always come back

The man behind the slaughter 2022"
lol copycat of zack snyder justice league bgm
jurrasic p ark survival evolved when
"I do not know the end of Dominion but I believe that as a script the end that really should exist in these films is for the company to try to collect the dinosaurs and rescue them by returning the animals back to their islands, where it all started ."
Trex frontflip https://youtu.be/YltM2vy88xY
🫠😱😱🫣🫠😂😂🫠😭😭🥹🥹🥺🥹🥹🥹🥹🥲💥
"Even though the movie is being released, I am still extremely sad that is the ""Epic Conclusion"". :( I never want these movies to end."
DUMB 👎 Can't imagine they could ever surpass the quality of the 1st Jurassic Park
"I don't get this movie already. the clone child released like 20-25 species dino's into the world n the last movie right? And this is now a threat to human kind? How did we get into a situation where there are hordes and hordes of dinosaurs to the point where humankind might struggle to survive/coexist, when we started with only 20-25 different ones? After only 4 years.

It is a complete surprise to everyone that blue had a baby.. .so.. that's somewhat new and never seen before, right?
How did we get at least 4-5 more species of dinosaur (33 ""confirmed"" species apparently?) that weren't a part of those original 20-25 at the release? you can't get new species of dino's from those original ones.. that's not how biology works.. and you can't get hundreds or thousands of dino's, to the point where it would affect humankind in any way, without it taking thousands of years and many generations, but this is set 4 years after those events.. so either way, even if they were breeding like bunnies, you wouldn't have a herd of ""adult"" dino's walking around either after only 4 years.

Am I missing something? please tell me if I am.."
So watching that in the summer
How the hell is the indominus Rex back like HOW
They screwed this series up worse than star wars.
Seeing the 1st movie og and the new og bringin them all into one final movie for the final time that wraps the Jurassic era 😭👏🏽💙🦖 the Jurassic Park/World crossover event we've all been asking for!!!!!!
Im so excited
It feels like when Tobey and Andrew returned in No Way Home
I can’t believe old timers came back. First ghostbusters the afterlife. And spider man no way home but except Andrew and now Jurassic world dominion
This feels like it will be as good as Jurassic world 2015 the fallen kingdom was not up to my expectation
So excited it brought me to tears
"Hammond: ""I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion. Something that was real...""
Trailer Editor: ""Let's play that clip over Chris Pratt riding a CGI horse!"""

"Jurassic park was probably the first movie I ever watched back in 2009, so this trailer made me more emotional than I'd like to admit."
"im watching this as soon as it comes out










i dont care if i have to pay a membership"
Super duper excited
Insanely magical😌
"FINALYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
🦖🦕"
"Got Goosebumps when i see Alan Grant ... Jurassic park was the First movie watched  on Theatre When i was 6, Now Jurassic world releasing on my Birthday 
Perfect Gift ❣️😁"
Just BEAUTIFUL
All of the Jurassic park movies suck? Jeff Goldblum can't act. The very idea of bringing back dinosaurs is not only extremely stupid its also extremely dangerous. They should have never made any of those movies. They should be sacked.
Now imagine jurasic francise crosover with planet apes franchise
"I. CAN'T. WAIT. So close, it's so close now! Cryy"
kalo tambah sarah bagus 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I am overwhelmed with nostalgia feels right now. The child in me is squealing with unparalleled delight. Bring on summer!!
epic
ONLY 41 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
"i'm in awe when i saw Dr. Ellie Sattler and Dr. Alan Grant, they bring back the first movie cast!"
0:27 bro that's some rough CG lol. Where are the shadows
"Life will finde a







Way"
"I’m imagining a horse that is shredded to pieces, then blended up and then milked to oblivion. That’s this movie."
1:57 Chris Pratt cast as William Afton in the FNaF movie confirmed? 👀
first im very lucky bc it relest on june 10th and my birthday is june 2th lucky me. secend maetel pls pls pls pls pls send me some Jurassic World Dominion Toys To Me Even Tho I Dont Have A youtube chanle I Still Love Jurassic World Dominion frome Jerome love your Movies.
"hmmm, ""I always come back"". Where have I heard that before?"
HOLY CRAP BLUE HAS  A BABY
Nice alla jurasic park movie actors in movie super direction
"It was a long wait but we finally have Sam Neill as Dr Grant return to the series is awesome. The original crew with Ellie and Malcom. And Maybe we have some of the other characters return like, Tim and Lex or Billy, Mr Kirby, Erik."
"Killer dinosaurs!  Fun for the whole family!  Don't worry, folks.  These are Hollywood Dinos.  They only kill the bad guys and the idiots in the film.  Can't wait to not watch this money grab"
"""The epic conclusion of the Jurassic era""

Until the reboot of course."
"I don't know how these stupid movies keep getting funded. Is no one aware of the fact that a single 20mm cannon could take down the baddest of these completely stupid creatures with a short burst? All it would take is a Humvee with a Chain Gun on top to wipe out an entire herd of these things. The idea of the world coming under threat from a species that died out millions of years ago is laughable. Please, no more silly dinosaur movies."
What have they done to this franchise 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
When I was playing my game and I was mad cause I lost but This just took all that anger away
My mom sent me this
my favorite franchise since my childhood days and to see Ellie and Doctor Grant just gave me goosebumps
"Now that's a big pile of sh*t.
look how they massacred my boy.
IF I'm going to watch this, it will be because of, you know why?
Rexy, Ian, Ellie and Alan!"
I’ve been waiting for this so long
My god the collaboration is real?!! I can't wait to see this in theaters!
I can't believe there is third film. These just keep getting better by the second and I just love how the jurassic Park actors came in
Yet another cash grab of nostalgia franchise...
"I think I’m going to be crying a lot watching the movie. I hate seeing dinosaurs die (I know it’s not real) but I still gets to me lol. And seeing the gang back together, it’s the perfect recipe for a tear jerker. But I hope the movie is going to be as overly depressing as Fallen Kingdom. It kind of lost the adventure aspect to it and wasn’t very fun. I hope Dominion gets back to the roots of Jurassic Park for the final movie."
This is a must see movie.
I feel like it is based off of the game
How are cold blooded animals a threat in snow?
Life will find a way.
In Gilbert Gottfreid voice: Enough with the dogwhistles already! 😂
"Awww... is that Blue and her kid??? So adorable!!! I miss you, Blue.."
"It's so cool that Jurassic World dominion comes out 1 day before my birthday

My birthday: 6/2/ ( Year ) 
I'm not going to say my year but that's so cool :0"
2:38 i think that is spino's foot
Another part? Lmao. Are they ever going to stop milking this franchise?
Ark fans go crazy right now
Holy fuck is this bad. I want to punch somebody in the face for this.
Im sold
"Colour tone could be better 
Not satisfied bros"
Wow this franchise really shit the bed didnt it
Heartthrob.....waiting for the action..☺☺
Jeff Goldblum. Chris Pratt. Enough said. I'll be there.
it's so gutting that Dickie isn't alive anymore to be in this film. he IS the voice of Jurassic Park. but with all the original cast being back it looks to be an amazing finish to the whole franchise
i feel like i'm that kid again first seeing JP1. So exciting to see this epic conclusion to all of it.
ONLY 42 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
The return of the originals! It looks promising. I have seen every one of the franchise movies a number of times. I can't wait to see this one. Nostalgia mixed with anticipation.
0:59 this part reminds me of the spinosaurs going in the water and attacking the boat in Jp3
"ok, just one issue with the entire plot of the entire goddamn movie. MILITARIES EXIST! do you genuinely think even 1 AC-130 gunship would not be able to kill literally every dinosaur there? they act as if even a small gun like a Kalashnikov couldn’t take a glorified lizard down? this movie has more plot holes than star wars the last jedi, Jesus christ. and the part where a pterodactyl attacks a massive hulking steel beast flying at 400 mph really makes me want to punch the writers and the director, would a small in comparison lizard bird not be shitting itself at the noise the plane makes alone?"
"0:38 It's a trip to live long enough to see something become a classic quote, and still remember when it was said for the first time."
Gak sabar nonton di 21
Awsome
ONLY ONE DOMINANT SPECIES CAN EXITS
This is going to be awesome! Brings the kid out of me to see Malcom and grant back together
I don't normally go to the movies but If I have to go to see this I will. Can't wait
This looks bad. But I will still watch it for the nostalgia
Best movie yet
"It will be an epic watch.
All the characters together, fighting to survive the new world.
Let's see who dominates."
Wow what an overblown fiesta of Jurassic Park nonsense everybody got Sam Neill goldblum and that Patrick Wilson looks like a real hoot not what a pierce the resistance
Nostalgia <3
"Dinos can be a problem in some deserted Island where you don't have enough resources, but in civilization where you can shoot them down with literally anything? It's ridiculous. A serious threat for civilization can be a volcano, asteroid, disease etc.. Not animals. May I remind you almost all big animals are already faster and stronger than us. Are we threatened by them?"
Mr campbell is still alive?
BABY BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Raptors casually roamed the streets of Italy and somehow no one ever thought ""huuuh, maybe we should call in the military ?"""

Don’t move , why do they always have to go bigger 😂"
I doubt Americans would have any problems with dinosaurs considering the firearms they own.
Yeah gonna go the midnight showing as soon as  possible. They got my gal Dilophosaurus there...been waiting to see her again since 1993!
Its about fucking time it went global ffs
OH MY IM SO EXCITED TO SEE ITT YAY!!
"Aren’t dinosaurs cold blooded, so they can’t survive cold climates?"
Sad for ending this era
it's not jurassic there's no T-rex

I'm pretty sure a large percentage of people about died from hype seeing the original cast I can't be the only one.
"I don’t know why nobody else is talking about this, but I just keep coming back to this trailer purely because they incorporated a sauropod singing into its soundtrack."
The whole concept/story behind this movie is just so unbelievably fucking stupid
I watch every film all parts in cinema never missed one .
Jeff Golddblum still hanging in there

"When the Diplodocus opens his mouth, that sound, I feel like I've heard this music in another trailer, I can't remember though."
My favorite movie !! And the baby Raptor is so cute !
Jurassic Park movies were the reason my passion for science begin
"I hope they have a genetically altered dinosaur that can speak english; and it first words to Sam Neil would be...""i am the Captain now, Merlin!!"""
I had a crazy dream at a very young age after watching the first Jurassic Park that a T-Rex would roam the streets I walk. Good to know they would make this an actual reality for viewers literally 30 years to the frickin’ day
"Please let this be the final one. Now they are just stretching the franchise unnecessarily. Spielberg's versions worked because it was never about the VFX and hyper realistic CGI or any vehicle chase sequences. He didn't need all this to create fear and excitement. It was always about the story. And man, the story of this franchise is going haywire since the last film. Good things come to an end. I hope they say goodbye with this one..."
Blue will come to the rescue and kick all the 'bad guy' dinosaurs asses. the end...

Well, how y'all feeling now?"
Sam Neil is now 74 years old. Give this man an award for being so awesome.

"Maybe I would, if it didn't have a lousy story, fanservice, cringe jokes/references, bad creative twists, too many unrealistic or absurd factors, excessive use of historical places and objects like that old plane. People keep wondering why the cinema is so mediocre these days and they are the ones who feed the mediocrity. You don't have to watch it to know that it's just a bigger, more exaggerated version of the previous two movies with no narrative value whatsoever."
mmm the first scenes showing temperate dinasours on the snow ... flashy but put me away
I can literally smell the popcorn.
"Let me remind you all how heavily Jeff Goldblum was promoted for the last one and how little he actually featured. Notice how most of the action scenes only have Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, not the original actors."
"Seeing the original cast brought tears to my eyes. I’m glad they’re back to help tie everything together and finish things off properly because their story was left unfinished.
I’m so curious how the new cast and old cast will deal with all this.
I’m also excited for more dinosaurs than raptors and T. rex. Give others time to shine."

"They should have kept secret about
Sam, jef and Lauren
It would have been more surprising for fans"
Omg the child in me jumped for joy!! Jurassic Park Franchise NEVER DISAPPOINTS! Unlike others that have been recreated. My entire family including my mom loves Jurrassic. I pray they make a prequel or sequel.
Maybe universal will learn a thing or two from prehistoric planet comes out.
It has to be said that modern weapons could easily blow the head off T rex or any large animals.
I wish I could experience watching this trailer for the first time again
Definitely want to go see this movie . It's awesome the original actors are back so great to see them back in that movie yayyyy👏
02:25
Awesome. Can't wait for this movie to arrive. Always a treat to watch this cast and all the dinos create havic.
Feel the same way everyone else does. There's something magical about the dinosaurs no matter how unrealistic a movie portrays them. It's been said the dinosaurs were God's favorite creature. Unfortunately he could not build a future with them. Thank God.
I remember being about 6 years old watching the original in theaters for the first time and being amazed at what I was witnessing.
2022 is a great year to be a movie fan
Looks Awesome!
I just hope it's not sad like the 2nd one
"Ok, besides the fact that Chris Pratt and Jeff Goldbloom are two of my favorite actors, seeing the old and new casts together just gets me so excited"
I love that Alan grant returns

Finally blue got a son or dauther? She is a proud mother and the movie will be awesome
Itsss gonnaaaa be epicccc ....
We waiting ✋ 😌 😝
Omg Allan Grant back
Finally they put dilhophersours
"Dinos, Dinos, and more Dinos. Can´t seem to get tired of those. This one looks more interesting than the last two so I am rooting for it."
Dr Ian Malcolm best lines. Fave character in the franchise.
"if you agree like this!!!!!


Jurassic world should have a Cenozoic movie"
Awesome 👍😎❤️❤️
We should bring them back to life lmao 😂
ONLY 46 DAYS BOIII😎👍💙
why they are ending this franchise? 😢😢
It's going to be something EPIC 🤯
"Big Dinosaurs need big guns.. i i have play the Anti-tank rifle in Dino Crisis 2 lol what guns u say to have the characters of Dominion?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBaIz9-hLwk"
Great.  Now I'm craving Popcorn!
"I honestly don’t think adding a few dinos is gonna make humans go extinct so thats a bit dramatic, but I really like the shoot with dinos and horses living togeather in joined groups. Thats a cool idea, imagening how our modern animals would react to and interact with these long extinct ones.^^"
Hopefully we get to see the spinosaurus and the three t rexes from lost world. That would be epic seeing all the major antagonist from the first trilogy go against the gigantosaurus.
Sam neills is back!I can't wait to see him in this movie!!
This film is a blatant cash grab
Will this be on Imax 3d?
"""I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion""
Thick irony, in a sea of CGI."
"The only reason I’m interested in seeing this movie is that Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are back, I skipped Fallen Kingdom cause i hated Jurassic World but I’m gonna have to watch it now, I might like it or maybe not. First film is great, 2 and 3 are quiet good but I despised JW, this might also suck but hopefully I like it."
"I don't know this is the direction they wana go, its starting to look like Fast & Furious all over again, what's next? Dinosaurs in Mars?"
I hope for a part 4 of this movie.
Is this series or movies ?
This is going to be amazing
When will the new trailer of Jurassic world Dominion part 2 the new trailer the new trailer is coming this week who knows I can't wait to see it when it come out so we'll see 🦖🦖🎉🎉
I want to see the movie now
I have watched this series since I was 7 ~2015 and it was always something looked foreword to but now I don't know what I will do now something never thought about was the series ending
"I just watched the trailer for the first time. When Laura Dern was revealed, I began to cry. As characters from the original films began to appear I wept.  I have a gift that allows me to predict the success of movies that I can't explain. However, trust me when I say that this will be the best damn action/adventure film ever made. Not only that but it WILL break the $1 Billion mark at the box office opening weekend. I guarantee it!"
No joke every time I watch this trailer I cry
2:33 thats the gang
Why do I have a feeling that rexy's gonna die in this movie
I get chills with blue and her baby
Imagine just fishing and you see a mosasaurus eat another fishing boat

"Garbage movies, Jurassic world is an abomination and a disgrace to the Jurassic park epic written by Michael Crichton. Shame on the writers and directors of this dogshit"
i like the feathered raptor
"Sam Neills character will die and that will set off the heart of the movie, typical Hollywood cliches"
i guarantee this movie will be shit
"the conclusion, no please"
He said the Fnaf thing : I always come back
"This trilogy is like the sequel Trilogy of Star Wars, keeping changing directors and different styles. Hope they don't mess it up in this movie, it truly is the finale of a generation, the same style like The Rise Of Skywalker."
Owen Grady is  the Hiccup of the Jurassic World.
"Ik everyone is obsessing over the return of alan and shit, but tbh i wanna see Zach and Grayson at least one more time bruh"

"Ależ będę oglądał, sam wszystko obejrzę w kinie <3"
Doesn't matter if you were fan in the 90's or just tuning in This movie looks amazing 🤌
I can't wait!!! 🤗
I tried so hard but couldn’t it’s to dark and the plot of the second one doesn’t make sense human beings are trying to go back and save big ass dinosaurs from a volcanic eruption that was the second one of Jurassic world which I loved so I can’t with this and I won’t even try..
"""Congrats to everyone who  is early and found this comment"""
oh man 😩😍
Because you’re finding the king; that’s why
1:56 Chris Pratt is Purple guy
Based on a true story.
If you watch this trailer then you have watched the entire movie
"No way. Physics works even with dinosaurs. No way a flying dino could be flying parallel to a plane. Even an old DC-3 cruised at over 200 mph. No bird, short of a Peregrine Falcon in a dive, can go even remotely that fast."
Wow I didn't think he'd be coming back. I thought he was pretty public with his desire to separate himself from the newer movies.
Dr Grant got a shotgun. I hope he hits whatever he shoots at this time.
dilophosaurus looks sick!
Omg the OGs
why does this series remind me of how the fast & furious series went??

"These guys realize that humanity hunted mammoths into extinction, stole homes from massive bears, wiped out a number of species and megafauna, and also hunted whales into extinction right?
Humanity is a force of destruction unparalleled in nature only submissive cataclysm that can be written as divine in act.
Needless to say dinosaurs would get fucked by modern humans."
Ooooh I feel the original on a bigger scale. But It won't be as good obviously. Sam Neil's still  looking good
"I got to see the first one in theaters when I was 8 in 1993, got in to see it because a friends mom took us to see it, and still remember how his mom tried to cover our eyes during the lawyer on the toilet scene. :P
I lost interest with the other movies, tried again with the first Jurassic World, but wasn't pulled back in, but... seeing a lot of the old cast returned in this one, I think I need to go see it, as there's a sense of nostalgia in a way."
Alan Grant 😍😍
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
"I swear to all that is paleo that if they kill of any of the original crew, I'll go Indominus Rex on them."
"“I always come back”, fnaf fans you know what I’m sayin"
"When it comes to the matter of computer effects, so widely reported on Jurassic Park, remember that the real pioneer in these matters was Terminator 2."
I am waiting for the release of this film
Jurassic world dominion
Been in awe of this franchise since my parents showed me the first movie when I was 6. Since than I’ve see all the world movies in theaters. Some of the best times of my life
"Date saved. The last movie is imprinted in heart and mind. 
Can't wait to see how exciting this one's going to be."

"Any Ark: SE nerds in here? Only watched it once so far but feel like I saw Parasaurs, Therizinosaurus, Giganatosaurus, and Quetzal. Of course Mosasaur, Raptors, the usual. Maybe Deinonychus? Just cool to see some new things that I'm used to seeing only in a video game :)"
oh ho that's amazing

"I am so excited for this! Jurassic Park was the first movie I saw in a cinema at 3 or 4 years old. Now my 4-year-old son, who happens to love dinosaurs, will watch the final movie of the franchise for the very first time in a cinema, too!"
This is the greatest movie trailer ever

Perfect for the land before time live action movie with Chomper the tyrannosaurus and his friends in a reimagined movie
"I like this trailer, join the dinosaur protection group"
I'm so excited! Loved this franchise since being a child..
"Top Gun aiming to be the biggest release weekend in over a decade, possibly ever. 

2 weeks later - Jurassic Park ""Hold my beer."""
I love seeing the old cast but it's going to be hard seeing them the Jurassic World franchise. JW has been disappointing to the the absolute least.
"Tbh, I don’t care if the movie itself sucks. This is one of the best cinematic trailers I’ve ever seen. I get chills every time I watch it."
I will watch this mainly for the original cast.
Good Trailer
"Giọng Đức Phúc đỉnh quá đi mất. Nó kiểu mộc mạc, ko màu mè và nghe rất chân thành ấy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Mong 1 ngày sẽ được ngồi ở trời Đà Lạt và nghe Phúc hát 🎵"

"Not me wearing both airpods, noise-cancelling on, full screen, to have an emersive experience for this trailer...😅"
yay
blue had a baby!
"“I always come back”
*dies* (jk)"
It’s nice to see the old cast all together with new and the facts that the raptor has feathers as well as blue having a freaking baby is amazing!!!!
The raptor pack renewed with atricioraptors
"Man this trailer is awesome. Watching this one in cinema would be awesome. As a famous actor once said ""I am waiting..."""
right off the bat I can tell this is going to be a horrible movie.
"the tragic end of a series, for the money only. and one of the most useless actors. tragic garbage"
"It looks great. It would’ve been fun to get Julianne Moore back for this one, too."
It's cool they got the therizinosaurus and u know there herbivore right? Cause I was wondering if there going to be other Dino's could return like spinosaurus from jp 3 and it has dilposaurus on there.
With the pollution in this world all of them would die so fast……
Movie looks ass
LET'S GO !
"01:10 just call Turok in, he'd know how to hunt these beasts down."
ONLY 52 DAYS BOIIII😎👍💙
The noise at 0:26 litteraly messes with my brain to the point that i just want to go to the cinema to watch the trailer/ad and hear it. I'm on my computer rn with my decent headset but it doesn't do anything. It really only works with the cinema's audio rig but damn it my brain orgasms when it hears it.
"1993 was the birth of this amazing franchise
2022 was the end of this amazing franchise

To the directors please don't ruin this conclusion"
Godzilla is making a guest appearance huh 😺
I hope we get a triple threat match trex vs spinosaurus vs giganotosaurus
"these are all the dinosaurs in the trailer...
Parasaurolophus
Velociraptor
Apatosaurus
Mosasaurus
Tyrannosaurus Rex
Therizinosaurus
AustroRaptor
UtahRaptor
Allosaurus
Carnosaurus
Quetzalcoatlus
Dilophosaurus
nasutoceratops

Giganotosaurus
and prob some more that I didn't see."
"what i see new dinos is a 
therizinosaurus,deinonychus,pyroraptor,quetzal what it looks like"
yo what Gregory doin out the pizza plex 1:55
Looking forward to this! Glad they brought back the og cast.
Tim Murphy better have a surprise role.  Like stepping in to defend his grandpa's creation or something.
Why do I have a feeling that the franchise is gonna be the same result as the Godzilla franchise where it will be rebooted again because some shitty company is gonna give a bad reputation to the franchise
I was shocked when the old cast made an appearance and I am very excited to see this film :D
"Dr Grant, Ian and Ellie should be untouchable in this movie man. I'd rather have chris pratt and bryce dallas howard eaten by some dino. Just don't touch the 3 main, specially Dr Grant lol"
"The fact that 2 of my fave dinos growing up, are part of this final film, blows me away.  Call it ego, but they might've heard my requests & rants from years ago. The Reaper & The Giga Chad. 
(Giganotosaurus, Therizinosaurus)"

Rip the other raptors echo bravo delta….
ive seen better c.g.i 15 years ago. they are either saving money with this trash or getting the public used to low quality fakes. sad
Jesus Christ saves!
This is how star wars should have felt.
To bring back the greatest actors from the past movie will be the most exciting movie in one with our century dinosaur 🦕 in the greatest movie ever ❤️👏🙌😉👌😃
This is dumb.  Saw the original in theater and it was ok for the time.  All subsequent iterations have sucked as this one will.  I will not watch this one.
"When I was a wee lad I saw the first jurassic park with my parents in a drive in theater, I'm so happy to be alive to see this in theaters."
But how did the Dino’s take over?
"They've been crapping all over this franchise and Michael Crichton's original vision for decades. This is clearly just the latest monster movie shlock. The original film is a classic, but the sequels always make the same mistakes."
I got chills when I saw the original cast that’s what I’m talking bout
Baby raptor!!!!!!  Baby Blue!!!!!!!!!!!!! Squeeeeee!!!!
Jurassic Park and Jurassic World were my favorite movies. The sequels were awesome too. Can’t wait for this movie
"I hope they brought back Dr Okun too...
And Jar Jar Binks"
"Is my best movie
 😘Made much wait to see it💪
 I love Jurassic park and world ❤️"
"Crazy to know that most of these dinosaurs actually had feathers like birds, including the T. rex"
I am completely lost of why so many are roaming free all over the world and in cities. Makes zero sense
Can't wait to see the Battle between the Sp---------- vs Giganotosaurus😁
I don’t think I’ve ever been this excited for a movie in my entire life 🤩
Can’t wait

"YEAH guys 
JURASSIC WORLD DOMINION 
     FULL OFFICIAL TRAILER  2 RELEASE ON APRIL 28 THIS MONTH 

THESES ARE TEASER STILL VERY GREAT"
Its nice that blue had a baby but as a raptor how is it she got so much bigger? Aren't they supposed to be the same size as the previous movies?
I THINK THE OFFICIAL TRAILER 2 WILL COME ON APRIL 28 I SUMMING
"Man,I'm so excited for this movie to come out until School ends,Us Dinosaur Fans will see this movie at June and Theaters"
6:35 má ơi vậy cũng được bó tay luôn
blue is back
1:14 this melody hits me thousand year
Wow nice everyone is back
"I think the sad thing is, once this Trilogy is over - there probably won't be another great dinosaur movie like this... ever again."
I miss indominus Rex tbh
I hope this could bring back the “fear” that the first Jurassic park shared
So what is exactly the new hybrid in this movie?
I’m literally tripping right now my life just flashed before my eyes this may be the last one but in my child of a heart I will always remember what drew me closer to dinosaurs 😢
I don’t really think they would last vary long the United States has a lot of gun owners and a lot of hunters all im saying is if there were deextincted dino running around i dont think id have to wait for fish and game to declare a season. And as we saw in the previous film 9mm apparently drops a raptor no problem. Im guessing there’s enough barrette 50 owners that everything else wouldn’t be an issue either
"From the moment Richard Attenborough says welcome to Jurassic Park, I got goosebumps and was hooked. It was GENIUS to use his voice for this trailer. He was a wonderful actor and so believable in his role as Hammond. This movie is going to make me sad but I am excited to see it come full circle."
"This franchise really has been ruined hasn't it? 
Fictional dino's cuz the dino's that exist arent scary or good enough?
Dino's with human emotions and intelligence? Lets forget for a second that it is even showing more emotion and intelligence than most in the upper tier of mammals... and even that freaking the emotions and brain of lizards/birds work very different
Oh and then we now have a movie in which dino's thrive in cold weather?? they freaking cold blooded."
"1:06 well you can blame the clone girl for that, useless characters probably got many people killed by the Dino’s she released."
I don’t think I’m gonna be a fan and get used to the dinosaurs having hair now
If blue dies and is replaced with that little weasel I’m gonna cry for hours
"It's good to see the OGs, Ellie and Allen Grant, but wtf was that at the end? That shit looks like Godzilla 😳"
I was so obsessed with Jurassic Park so happy then finally released DOMINION!!! Can’t wait to see blueeee again!
https://youtu.be/2M_f7xwhN24

"This is going to hurt when it’s over , literally my whole childhood to adulthood in this series! Glad to see the returns of the OG cast! Can’t wait to experience this final masterpiece!"
sơn ca diễn cũng duyên quá chứ
Can I just say how awful the cgi looks in this trailer… 😕
Can you imagine if at the end of this movie they show 50 years later or more showing humans living like cave people in a Dino world?!
The sfx looks weak
I reply want see this
We don't know if Samuel L. Jackson died or not. He could have spliced his missing arm ( just like the Lizard in Spiderman to rejuvenate his arm ) to become the king of dinosaurs being the first Humanasaur.

Jurassic Park Endgame
People saying this movie is not going to be good. No shit. But you aren't gonna find any new movies with dinosaurs
"Can’t wait to see this, super excited🥰"
"Dilophosaurus, gigantosaurus, real velociraptor (with feathers like science proved), dinoneicus, ol' t rex, no hybrid bulls%*$ carnivore, pteranodon,  archeopteryx . I hope this final chapter will have more of a jurassic park (1st one) tone than what whe had in Jurassic world 1&2"
Omg I really want to see this movie especially since the cast from Jurassic park are returning
It comes the day after my birthday
Best Visual Effects nominee come 2023 Oscars.
can't believe there bringing the dilophosaurus back
"Please, for the love of God stop making these awful movies."

Justice for the spitter
OH MY GOSH IM SO EXCITEEEEDDDDDDD
If we are absent dinosaurs can live in peace if we are not there dinosaurs will have a extremely great life.
"And this is why folks, you listen when people say dinosaurs are dangerous, but no one listens 🤷🏽‍♀️. Humans am i right ?"
Can’t wait
That dionosure echo sound starting in trailer goosebumps
The last time I watched this I had a literal seizsur
Missing Irfan Khan here
There's no new recipe in this trailer but i'll still watch this movie just because i want to see the reunion of Ellie and Alan. I like them.
This looks like awful nostalgia bait. Humans would immediately hunt dinosaurs to extinction. They'd have ot be protected by the government on stupid dinosaur reservations.
"When I was kid, my dad took me to a local theater to watch the first sequel. Then, as my birthday present, my dad took me again to watch the second sequel. My cousin and I watched the third, as a treat for my cousin first salary. I watched the fourth with my gf. I watched the fifth with my ex (she is now my wife). For now, I will watch the sixth with my son."
Ooooooo. Hmmmmm

Who did blue mate with? (She was the last of her kind)
"I did see the teaser 2 giganotosaurus 
But we need to have THE
 OFFICIAL TRAILER 2 FULL TRAILER I WICH FULL TRAILER 2 COMES MAN"
It might get bad reviews from the movie critics but I bet everyone else as far as the audience itself will love it
I only get a palpable sense of fear and horror in Jurassic park 1 and 3
solid movie..
Atlast the dominion
Sam Neill is a king
Netflix: ah a nice da- jurrasic park domain:opens Netflix:dies
Anh đức phúc hát hay quá 😍😍❤❤
I can't wait until the movie is out!🤑
T-Rex is my favorite but I’m so glad we get to see a Dilophosaurus again.
Such A great franchise I wish this wasn't the end this franchise made me who I am it made want to discover the past now I study every day Intel Im old enough to become a paleotologist
Road to 50m !!!
I love dinosaurs
The fact all of this could've been possibly avoided if they only brought back the Herbivore Dinosaurs (maybe) 🤣😭😂
Where can I watch this movie
The CG is so fake.
"I cannot tell you how many times I went 'oh my god' watching this for the first time, I've been keeping up with this franchise ever since I could talk and have enjoyed the excitement of every sequel since then be released and this one is no different, I'm so excited!!!"
IM SO HYPED FOR THIS
cant wait for this to come out  it looks amazingg
Finally we get to walk with the dinosaurs. I cannot wait to watch this in IMAX
the best movie ! 🤯😃
"actually looks like shit, typical Action movie without real love for showing dinosaurs in a ""realistic or imaginable"" way like the old movies. 

""bigger... why do they always have to go bigger"" fits that narrative quiet well...."
"So I think I came up with a theory about how blue has a baby.

So Blue is ment to be the last one raptor of her pack, and species. 

And REXY is from the very beginning of jurassic Park. John Hammond, young Henry wu, ex.

And in jurassic Park they said that all dinos were girls, and that they can't mate.
BUT when Alan Grant found dino eggs with lex, and Tim, he figured out that when they used frog DNA to fill in the DNA stan, some African frogs can change sex so they could lay eggs. 

Now here's the best part.

In jurassic World fallen kingdom, blue got shot, and the veterinarian needed a blood type good enough so that way blue didn't die on the operating table. No more then 2 or 3 fingers.

They had 2 on board, but who did they get it from? Rexy.

And Rexy's Blood still has the same DNA that is filled with that frog DNA that can swap sex to lay eggs.

And they gave some to blue.

Blue had a baby, because of rexy's DNA from Jurassic Park.

Life...
Found...
A...
Mother...
Fucking...
WAY!!!"
All it’s missing is Lex and Tim!! But this gave me Goosebumps!! I miss the 90s
"This cast, this trailer, this legacy is pure goosebumps!! 
I'm beyond ecstatic for this one ❤️"
hài quá
"I got goosebump all the entire scene, especially when Alan Grant appeared tho ...!!

cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
awesome!!! can't wait
Yesss bc I love my Jurassic park/world ❤️❤️
well seeing as how this takes place a few years later after fallen kingdom and seeing as how the military doesn't have any control of the dinosaurs i'm gonna start a body count of how many people are gonna die from these things all thanks to that adorable little homicidal maniac maisie
"I am getting a feel that this will be the last part of this masterpiece, if it is true than it will be very sad"
amazing movie i can not stand waiting for it
What a pile of festering dino poop.  Count this as a downvote.
"The baby Raptor is Blue's cousin not her daughter, i don't know how but i just saw it in wikia that there are new 3 raptors including the one with blue."
I really like that Bo Burnham is back in this franchise.
I'm a sucker for a dinosaur movie.
Isn't Goldblum getting tired of doing the same scene over and over for decades?
This franchise doesn't seem to like the concept of guns
Hammoooond!!!
Woh fucked memory yup
Indomonius indorapter scorpios Rex what is next It would be nice to see them back I watched the series as a three year old
"Mario and the dinosaurs, can’t wait 😝"
Oh my word 😱 Old crew of JP from my childhood comes back to entertain me once again at my age of 30's 😍? Amazing franchise till date I ever seen producing & threatening kids even an adults mostly 💐 Goosebumps arresting me when I saw Sam Neil & Jeff Goldblum again in this upcoming epic 😁😘 Oh yeah I buckled up guys let's hold the breath at theatres 👍😁😱

"These films have ALL had the message, ""Maybe scientists shouldn't think they can mess around with powerful forces of nature without consequences."" And yet we have COVID-19, and dangerous bioweapons research being done in labs around the world. Time to listen?"
it looks like shit... it must be shit
Jurassic universe coming in 2035
Man I really thought spino was gonna be in here
"I hope the dinosaurs will get along better with the humans, perchance!"
Hearing John Hammond's voice again 😭😭😭 nuff said
THEY UPDATED THE DESIGNS YES FLUFFY
I love in part 3 when Dr.Grant says don't move and everybody takes off running 🤣
"Why cant they just go back to the original horror-style. Too much action, its just silly."
blue has BEBE
"Cảm giác như mk đang đc nghe 1 bản nhạc chữa lành vậy đó. Giọng hát của đp rất đặc biệt, nhẹ nhàng tình cảm. Xem video thôi đã hay ntn r, ghen tị vs ekip qaa nghe hát live chắc hay gấp 💯lần lunn"
2022 has a lot of good movies thus far
"No wonder nostalgia bait is strong

Just look at the majority of the comments"
I heard there would be a charactor well known that would die in the movie (as their role) wonder if that is true :o
"I'm excited to see this movie, Shooted in my city"
"I CANT HOLD IT ANYMORE MAN I WANT IS A TRAILER 2 FOR THIS MOVIE I READY WATCH THIS 
FRIST TRAILER  I wanna see TRAILER 2 I really wanna SEE"
"I gotta just stop letting my cynicism prevent me from enjoying these newer movies and just buy into the world. I still haven't seen the sequel to Jurassic World yet, but I should, and this film."
Unreal actually in tears
Seeing the old Jurassic cast with the new one is giving me so many feelings.
I'm excited.
What is the name film ؟
"I'm here for the dinosaurs first...don't care how ""questionable"" the written plot may be, because...dinosaurs!!!
Lol! XD"
"Jurassic Park was the first-ever English movie that I watched when I was young. I was not even born when it came out, I'm 24 now I still watch all the Franchise. My nephew watches with me, oddly I'm proud of it, this franchise never gets old. I'm experiencing all the emotions right now happy, excited, sad, etc. Bringing back the old memories is quite emotional, definitely going to watch this one in the theater."
Bà hoàng là người thằn lằn
The black lady in the plane is actually Darius's mom
So i just learned BioSyn is back in this film as is Dodgson (WEVE GOT HIM HERE) so my guess is all the new raptors and feathered dinos are biosyn finally getting in on the dino game
ONLY 58 DAYS BOIIII😎👍💙
OMG THIS IS REAL RIGHT NOW I LOVE JURASSIC WORLD 😆😆😆😅😄😃😁😄🆑
The dinosaur with wings looks the same as the three flying dinosaurs from ice age collision course
I'm definitely gonna watch this movie in theatre..
Please don’t screw it up like what happened to Fallen Kingdom.
"2:34
And Giganotosaurus enters."
"Why the fuck do people have this great tendency to ruin a movie by repeating the shit out of it? Fast and furious, pirates of Caribbean, Jurassic park etc etc... Just let them be... Your latest high end editing doesn't count shit if the story and acting is bad."
"1:56 William Afton?!?

Okay but no joke this film seems really interesting and i cant wait to see it :)"
Kgf 2 trailer out now
its getting stupid
"there's so much i hate about these movies but this was the only one that was slightly tolerable but again they never let go of the whole ""dinosaur = movie monster"" thing, the behaviors are wrong, the only good thing about this is at least they gave some dinosaurs feathers but everything else is just bad"
We Want spinosauris back
I bet if I state my opinion on which movie is best people will come at me with hate and rage. :p
This is literally Ark the video game
"""Creation is an act of sheer will"" fucking got me dude.. and the piano behind. Pure goosebumps right there"
even though wasnt born when the original trilogy was released I still grew up with this franchise haven't been into for years but after seeing this trailer I'm now gonna get back into this franchise one final time unless they release another one down the line.
"I loved the original.  Still
One of my faves.  I’ll see this just for Laura Jeff and Sam!  Like so nostalgic"
"Cash in. Like the scream franchise cashed in. 
A positive experience quickly turns into disappointing one on seeing a above average Hollywood movie, when you realise there will be 5 more inferior ones after it.
A serious lack of imagination in Hollywood"
Film favorit gua masa kecil 👍
"Eh, the new jurassic world series just doesn't capture the feeling of the original jurassic park films, I respect what they're trying to do but films these days are just shoved out with half assed scripts and ridiculously cartoonish cgi to sell more tickets. Cool they have the og cast tho."
Shits getting real !! No pun intended lol
Is this will be in cinema or netflix? I cant wait!!
i must say Bryce Dallas Howard and that dinosaur should have a screaming match at 2:29
"Pepsi, where the old generation meets the new generation..."
This came out right after my birthday
Dude i love the bike chase scene with the 2 random dinos on the plaza
Looks pretty garbage tbh
They really should have stopped with this series in 1993.  That was all we needed.  So what happens in THIS movie that no one can predict?  Aliens?
"I hope they don’t kill off doctor grant , he brings good memories , it’ll be disappointing if they did ."
samo samo....
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww its incredible como se llaman me gustan los dinosaurios
"I don't really get this, oh no dinosaurs. they can eat humans so we are gonna be wiped out.. there is nothing like missiles guns or the like that could possibly blow a dinosaur to pieces.."
"What a shame!
Even from trailer i could tell this movie is going to be retarded like prequels,
And oh boy looking from the comments they did it again with nostalgia crap 
Well who cares not billion dollars eh!"
Why the hell do they show almost full movie snaps? where is the art of making a trailer that would make you long for the movie to come?
I am wating for this movie.
Life will find away
Waiting 👌🔥😍
Dr Ian Malcolm and Dr Alan grant dr ellie sattler is back!!! From Jurassic park
"I never knew the names of all the dinos in the older movies watching them as a kid, but after having 1700 hours of playing ARK: Survival Evolved, I recognize all the creatures in this trailer🤣🤣🤣"
♥️
ratio
Damn Chris Pratt is a marvel superhero and a bloody dinosaur man
Daddy are the gonna sell raptor nuggets at the movie theatre?
This better be 3 hours long
Im not gonna lie when i first saw this i cried a little
I'm so pumped for this movie
Cool
Nice YouTube video this is really cool
"Seeing the original cast makes me smile. I was gonna watch it anyway because dinosaurs, but having them will make it better for everyone who loves the original Jurassic Park trilogy."
1:55 Chris pratt = purple guy? (I ALWAYS COME BACK)
I'm sad but yet excited that we're getting a new film but it's also the last film.
OMGGGG I CANT WAITTTT!!!
Yessss
"Just can't beat the old cast and original scenarios. New one is good, but not great."
By now Jeff Goldblum's character is sick of folks not listening to a word he's said throughout the franchise.
Blue got a little blue!!!! 🥰🥰 so cute~
"The raptor has FEATHERS, FEATHERS,FEATHERS! GREAT JOB, I LOVE YOU"
"I am searching for her velociraptor mate, it's time for blue's clues."
I remember when I watched the original........ 65 million years ago... :/
I'm getting Independence Day: Resurgence vibes from this and that is NOT a good thing...
This movie is gonna be amazing
"Please make it stop! No more Jurassic Park/World films...



I guess at least it's not Transformers"
"It's not a Pyroraptor. It is a Deinonychus! The Deinonychus was discovered by John Ostrom. The Paleontologist who revolutionized The way we understand dinosaurs today. He came up with the theory that Dinosaurs are more bird-like. THE Velociraptors in the original Jurassic Park are really Deinonychus, but Micheal Crichton thought that Velociraptor sounded more sexy. But now, hopefully with the new Jurassic World movie, Uncle John's legacy is redeemed, with Deinonychus having a big part in the movie!"
Im going to scream when i walk in the theatres to see this!
Star lord next i Indiana Jones 🙉
"I just want to see the plot twist where it turns out Chris Pratt is the bratty kid that Sam Neill scares at the beginning of JP1.  ""The point is... You are alive when they start to eat you""."
I hope spino and trex will team up to beat giga
I hope Owen and Claire are together as I heard they get married dk though
Can’t wait
"Damn. The Animated TV show is Canon to this. So I wonder where all those kids are? They left dinosaurs, and came right back into dinosaurs. Damn."
love the trailer but i really thought the megalodon woulda been here
Ok so did anyone notice in the trailer the shot of Ellie and Claire looking out a window in a lab. I think this is a homage to that famous scene where Ellie finds Sam Jackson’s body and is chased by a raptor.
"lmao, this looks so terrible."
1:48 wow dude finally realistic i just couldn't belive how crazy people went over JUrassIc pARK'S RAPtorS ARe FaKE
Oh man. The child in me just screamed for joy. This looks awesome! It would have been even better if the boy and girl from the first one came back as adults.
2:03 that allosaurus gen 2 from Jurassic world alive.
BABY BLUE LES GOOOO!!!!
Love to see all of them together once again ❤❤❤👍😎🤝
"Omg! Brings back so many memories with the original casts. I am just beyond excited for this, I think I'm gonna 🤮😅❤️"
1:56 is that William afton?
I Like PTENARODON.
I love how owen ruins allosaurus and carnotaurus's fight. 2:03
So where is Kaidou?
The Alan look at 1:21
"From India ,we Love to watch Jurassic  park from elder to kids ....all people like to watch ....Wat a curious  movies ....Better pls put this movie in Amazon prime after 2 months movie release we wanted to watch more than 1 time."
Raptors in London
"Boo ""creation is an act of will""

Very bad cgi
I don’t see anyone talking about the return of the dilophasurus. I love how you can see that it’s a really great looking animatronic
bro i waited so many years for this movie but no new hybrid? aw man >:(
Very nice i wait this which 😍
I get it's just a movie but that Quetzalcoatlus bringing down a plane or attacking it in the first place is the dumbest and silliest thing i've ever seen in a Jurassic Park movie
Apocalypse movie
Awesome trailer waiting for it and kgf chapter 2.
My most anticipated movie in 2022🔥🔥🤩🤩🥳💥🎉
i still remember the theatre experience of Jurassic Park (1993) .. that film will be the most watched movie among the jurassic park series ..  The curiosity while watching that movie on that time ..wordless !! because of that movie experience we still ready to watch jurassic world dominion ..
Baby blue 🥰🥰
Guess guns and missiles and tanks and jets are no longer a thing
awesome
Can't Wait!!!!
"I watched the Jurassic island trailer 
And I want to leave this world"
IM SORRY NEVER NEVER STAND STILL WHEN YOU SEE A GIGA EUN YOUR ASS OFF HE IS NOT LIKE THE TREX THAT SEES ONLY IF YOU MOVE HE HAS BINOCULAR VISION  AND CAN SEE EVERYTHING
"I already know this will NEVER capture the magic of the first film; but guys! .... they finally brought back one of the best dinosaurs from the first film: Dilophosaurus aka ""The Spitter"" !! 2:30 !!!"
"I doubt that this will be the end of Jurassic World.  ""The conclusion to the JURASSIC Era"".  What came after the Jurassic?  Right. The cretaceous period.  This ain't the end."
"i seriously hope this doesn’t go down the path star wars did, with the new sequels just relying on nostalgia. plz don’t let this go the same path."
"Can you add “Wii Play Motion” Trigger Twist Dinosaur Stage please?🎮🦖

And one more thing can you add Deinosuchus & Megalodon please?🐊🦈"

"Chills, literal chills, all the hairs on my body give the standing ovation."

I’m so exited to see the whole thing this is probobly gonna be the best movie they ever made!
I hope the T-rex won’t die ! He’s my favorite! I can’t wait! :)

This seems promising. Crosses fingers
Nice to see ARK made a movie LOL
Am I the only one that hope spiny is in this one ☝️ although Jurassic 3 wasn’t a hit like the first 2 I really think we need to see spiny return and have a another match with another T. rex
I want the new dinosaur to have some indominus dna
I can’t wait to go see this movie this summer 😁😁😁
What an amazing experience it has been with this franchise since my childhood...first day first show
I can't wait for it at the cinema.  why is it taking so long
0:32 is so cute! Too bad this is the final movie for the franchise though :(
Blue has a BABY YESS VERY COOL AND CUTE

"Is it me or have we reached some kind of peak concerning the quality of the CGI ? I feel like no major approvement has been made in the recent years. Too bad we went from ""THIS IS UNREAL"" from the first Jurassic Park to ""Meh, i can't unseen that this dinosaur is CGI made""."

"In order to properly keep the hype for Dominion and allow the fans to appreciate the end of the series in its glorious entirety, Camp Cretaceous season 5 should launch before Jurassic World Dominion. 
Dominion, as the conclusion of the franchise should not be the leader for Camp Cretaceous. Instead, Camp Cretaceous’s ending should lead into the ending of the entire saga, with Dominion. This makes the most sense from a fan, promotional, and experience standpoint, in my (and a lot of other fans’) opinion(s)."
"Before there was Marvel, the Jurassic Park franchise was the dearest thing to my heart as a child! Along with the Walking With Dinosaurs documentaries and others, dinosaurs were the biggest thing to me and the first movie made them look, act, and feel so real and I loved it! The actors were so much fun to watch too, and the CGI and special effects there were so amazing that even after 20 years that technology has evolved, it still holds up well to today and has aged well like fine wine! I can't wait to see the old gang mix with the current characters Owen and Claire, and so many dinosaurs, this movie is going to be so epic and large-scale it may as well be the Avengers: Endgame of the Jurassic Park/World saga. I wouldn't be surprised if it gave Endgame and No Way Home a run for their money in the first couple of months"
Damn...this looks really good...
Where is the Title in Trailer ?
Jurassic Park No Way Home 😂💙
More like Geriatric World..... hasn't Hollywood learned its lesson? Bringing back these old farts from our childhood != good movie
Chị hướng dẫn bài Mộng chiều xuân được không chị ơiiii

Chúc gia đình luôn hạnh phúc.... Được nhiều view hơn nhé !!!! 殺
I hope this movie is 3 hours long. I cant wait. The longer the better I dont even care is it is as long as a Harry Potter movie
I´m so excited for this!🦖💚
"Theres no mate for the Mosasaur

Edit: I have dino fetish"
"Doesn't bother anyone, that dinosaur's have been extinct for millions of yrs, but it's ok for Hollywood to cash in on them??.."

"This is just as bad as the last 2... 
What this director doesn't understand is that Jurassic Park is a sci-fi, thriller franchise, and not an action franchise.... 
save the motorcycle chases, and bad guys with guns for Jason Bourne movies.  
Jurassic Park movies need to be intense, and jaw dropping. Viewers should feel afraid to look, and also feel afraid to look away."
So when will we get to see  the Fast and the Furious Jurassic World crossover..😂..
Shame they couldn’t get rights towards the original soundtrack
What is the release date of this movie?
Ngày xuân long phụng sum vầy. Bạn hướng dẫn cách đánh đàn Piano rất rễ hiểu. Chúc bạn cùng gia đình SK-HP và Thành Công

I really hope they use the filming techniques from the Jurassic park movies. Not going to lie you could tell that the raptors in Jurassic world were very animated and didn’t look real at all compared  the Jurassic park raptors.
I’m not clear on the plot anymore... How many dinos escaped in the last film? How have they repopulated the Earth already?
1:55 William afton
Like Godzilla vs kong
This is going to be soo much fun
I love the slow version of the original song when Dr. Grant & Dr. Sattler show up ❤🦖🦕
Did anyone else jump for joy at finally seeing the dilophosaur make another appearance?
"OMG Duc Phuc , i like your cover version. Love it !"
Will the film be available in Polish?
Is it just me or I just saw them actvaite the robot Dino in the intro bc they jumped or they went over a log who knows
I want Rexy to save the main cast and kick Giga's ass
"I love Jurassic Park. I hope they didn't take this one to far... hmmmm. I dunno, I'll have to wait and see."
"Humans tortured dinosaurs in the pass, now its their turn to torture humans back."
Wow Dino blue
I am so happy seeing a feathered raptor. They should reboot the franchise with more scientifically accurate dinosaurs.
"Remember seeing the first Jurassic Park movie as a kid, never been more excited to see a movie."
Lets goo🌋
This movie is gonna be EPIC!!!! I love Jurassic World/Park🦖🦖

Fun fact about a t rex: rexy is about 30 years old but a t rex life spand is about 28 years
Do be honest really like the snow in the trailer and I liked how the brung back the old cast from the original one
"Chris pratt: i always come back.

Me: fnaf reference?"
The people from jarrascic park omg
Blue and her son or daughter are cute
"Okay, this dinosaur thing was bad enough when they were brought back on an island, but the whole world. This has gone too far. Jeff Goldblum was right. “Getting Dinosaurs off this island is the bad island of all bad islands”."
"Best films. 
1. Jurassic Park
2. Jurassic World 
3. Jurassic Park 3
4. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom 
5. The Lost World Jurassic Park.

That's my own preference. I know people will have there own."
So cool and so wow because this is what I've been waiting for
"Can't bloody wait,super excited,I've been fan from the very beginning 93,looks fantastic so hope I'm not disappointed"
Love it ...cant wait to watch it in  3D .... it says conclusion  does that mean  its the  final one ??  hope not ... find  showing them as pets a bit over the top ... they should focus on the terror side of it ..
I knew that is Malcolm's girl :D oh boi
Dinosaurs doing parkour!? The new Mission Impossible trailer looks sickkk woahhhh

This is so freaking epic

Virgin JW: Dominion vs Chad Prehistoric Planet
"I'll most likely see this because the original cast is there, like a blast from the past. Watching Jurassic Park with my parents as a kid all those years ago."
"Gotta be honest, I've lost my habit of this franchise for over 3 years but after seeing this trailer, I really want to get back in the franchise."
so many jurrasic park movies  yet still no dino crisis sequel games ! we are still waiting :<
QUETZALCOATLUS OMG!!!!!
And still Steven Spielberg remain a legend long after I die
is that wallet makerat a pallet
Woah my sons gone love itttt
I have no words to explain that how much I love Jurrasic series....Its like a baby for me...#Sam Neil and other old castes remembering my childhood days....my favourite part is Jurrasic Park 3....Am waiting for this Legendary movie...cant wait ...😍😍😍😍😍
I think this is gonna be the best Jurassic film of all time
"What they've done with this franchise...  Sometimes it feels like I woke up in a parallel world where nothing makes sense. 

Please just end this franchise as soon as possible, it already looks pathetic, no fan asked for this kind of generic movie, I refuse to see these movies, and I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park trilogy.
Jurassic Park was part of my youth, I breathed dinosaurs when I was a kid, and it was Jurassic Park that made me fall in love with dinosaurs, and nature. I feel sorry for kids nowadays who can't feel the impact a kid in the 90s felt watching Jurassic Park."
"1993 to 2022, almost 30 years, this series never disappoint to excite us.. Waiting for this movie...."
There's no way those dinosaurs could survive in the snow. The earth was much different 65 million years ago and was much hotter
Um? Does anyone even bother realizing that Blue has a little one with her? Personally I would love for Dr. Grant meet these Raptors in some way.
It’s giving me Spider-Man NWH vibes😂😂 I’m here for it!!😎
"I must be the only person here who thinks this looks even dumber than the previous sequels. The screaming face to face scene, the specific targeting of the plane's engines to disable it, Sam Neill looking directly at the camera, ugh... I've enjoyed these films for what they are, but this looks like they're lowering the bar even more."
ich sehe das Realistisch es wird wie immer gut gemacht aber absolut Unrealistisch denn sie würden in unserer Welt nicht überleben
Why are characters in Jurassic Park jumping longer distances than world record holders?
Cant wait!!!
It's like a 007 movie except the bad guys are dinosaurs 🤣 😅🙈
"This has become more and more like ""Dino Crisis"".
Buckle up guys."
Which was the dinosaur at the last part of trailer that the Alan and crew staring at ?
Bro oem litterly said something that we can see end touch that was in jurassic park 1
"I'm not excited for this movie 😒😒😒😒, it's very over-saturated.
The first Jurassic World movie was great, but Fallen Kingdom is a pile of shit, it's story goes way faster that it's suppose to, it wasted a lot of characters and it's so boring.
And for me, this trailer looks mediocre and ultra exaggerated, like this is pure fan service, the old cast returning makes me happy but furious at the same time, ever since Fallen Kingdom started making cringe jokes with their characters that they were already great in the first film, the old cast in this film will probably make cringe jokes too, so yeah, this film will definitely suck and be a massive disappointment. (JUST MY OPINION)"
CGI is lacking.
Why are there loads of the same comments copied and pasted on here?
Thats it... Going to watch all jurassic park and world movies again
This looks like a no brainer. I fucking love it.
Missing John Hammond
Call-back on point 👌
Tingles!
can't wait to see this !! I live on the island of Malta and the street scenes at 1:41 and 2:00 are our Capitol - very exciting to get dinosaurs here 🦕
OH WHO I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS ONE I HAVE ALL THE 1 TO THE LAST ONE I WANT THIS WANT TOO ON MY COLLECTION
I refuse to believe that we could create enough animals of that size in such numbers to dethrone the human race. It must take years to reach adulthood and years more between generations. At most with the most liberal estimates the population could only be 5-6 time the original population. With a starting population of dinosaurs that could fit on two islands. Also without genetic modification between generations the babies would end up having three legs or six eyes because the only animals there are their cousins.
1: DILOPHOSAURUS IS BACK YES!!!! 2: I freaked when grant came back. 3: baby blue is adorable!!! 4: I’m more than exited
Ark survival evolved
Well at least Bryce Dallas Howard isn't running in high heels anymore...
Let's we clone dinosaurs and then they attack us.....  New idea-   check
ya’ll have no idea how excited i am. i grew up watching jarassic park while my parents werent there for me. i watch all the films whenever i feel down. and now the og cast are back??? i deadass feel like crying
This made me watch the Jurassic park trilogy all over again
I love Jurassic Park all sequels but why it must be the last of it...
Finally old cast back in the movie. I like the idea of bringing old cast to this sequel. It's nostalgic . I will definitely go to theatres for this movie.
"I really really have a huge dichotomy with this movies, in the way of what are and what they should be. And actually I don't know who is winning."
Ark Survival evolved:  The Movie looks good !
feed me please
"Idk what I think of it. It's beautiful and the story looks interesting. But if we can resume it on ""Kill dinosaurs"" only isn't very important to see this movie."
WHY ID THIS YESR SO GOOOF
yesssssss u jurasic world always the best thx universal u are the best tooo siiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Its the tráiler oficial. :v
I’ve been waiting so long to see a giga on the big screen.
The trailer for Jurassic world domination is awesome can’t what to see it 🦖
It looks dreadful!
I've seen something like this but I still love it. I'll see it again.
Can't wait to see this at the big screen!!!
"Mr. Goldblum, the saying is go big or go home. SO THEY GET BIGGER LOL!!!!!!!"
BRO IM DYING THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOMe !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I am so looking forward to this, they better not have just shown me all the best bits."
So is the Giga bigger than JP3 Spino?
HURRRRREEY UP PLEASE OMFGGGGG
If Ellie alan malcom is back then spinosaurus should also be back
and finally acurate raptors
its baby blue from the lego series!
Ark Vibes !!
Bro baby blue is the fucking cutest thing on world
"I’m still not over the deaths of Charlie, Delta, and Echo. If something happens to Blue’s offspring I’m gonna have words with Mr. Spielberg."
"I can hear Honest Trailers now, ""ALAN""!"
"When this is released in theaters, they ought to do an encore showing for a limited time of the original 1993 film in re-mastered quality!"
When are they making a new Aladar dinosaur movie
"Cool........
Seen this too?
https://youtube.com/shorts/OJgD-Xot7eo?feature=share"
man this looks mondo stupid
The real fun was only in first and 2nd part of Jurassic park.. .. not it feels like illogical futuristic story. 😔😔
"""They're just like me."" (Next ""They"" create Mass Human Extinction)
Remember, the people in Hollywood think they're morally superior to you ""dumb masses"" because they would mass genocide you over the ""feelings"" of a science experiment."
I'd only watch this for the original cast.
It is so good
Please make this movie happen! My kids love the Jurassic Park / World adventures! Every movie lights a fire behind their eyes that only these movies can bring!!

Really wish the spinosaurus would make one last appearance
Finally someone with feathers
I can’t wait to see Jurassic World Dominion
I will love this movie!
Definitely worth the wait
Much more hyped than Black Adam! 🖤
"jurassic world 3 have new dino giganotosaurus,terizinosaurus,quezalcoatl,utaraptor,nasuceratop"
"I wish they had a more accurate dilo, but I get that the venom spitting, frilled critter is kind of iconic to the first movie at this point. Either way, I'm so excited to see this. It's nostalgic and heartwarming seeing the original cast come back, and brings back a lot of great memories from when I was a wee child. ♥"

Finally some feathers! :)
the trailer is amazing!
Fix the CGI!!
i am waiting for the hall time for the another part of jurassic my father is telling me that the fallen kingdom is the last par but i alaways saying there is going to be another part will reales
"I would suggest to make a series out of it,
It would give the storyline more time as compared to movies because in a movie you have a short window because of which you have to cram everything up in a short time,
A series will definitely be more satisfying,give it a thought,
It can do a lot better than game of thrones i can assure you that."
She died or not?

"Almost 20 years since the first Jurassic Park film and the dinosaurs somehow look worse in this new film, the CGI just isn't convincing enough."
Cant wait for the movie
"I delivered to the Pinewood set while they were making this movie, it was about 9pm.   Pinewood is a massive site.  I took a wrong turn in the dark and found myself by a massive under some huge palm trees….  It looked so real,  then people with clip boards emerged from the dark and told me I had driven onto their film set .  
Before I left I got in the queue at a caravan serving food,   I only wanted to buy a coffee for the 4 hour return journey home.  I got all the way to the counter and some arrogant *****. told me to leave
I only wanted a drink , it’s not as if I wanted my name in the titles or anything. As I was walking back to my van I heard several r soles in the queue laughing at me.    Damn that was an 8 hour drive on minimum wage"
Waiting for it for 4 years
"I can’t wait, the original cast so excited!!"
I’m not ready for it to end… I’m so emotional. I remember watching jurassic park as a kid and now they’re in this one.  I could cry. It’ll be iconic
"Hate to see it end! But they pulled everyone back together for the big finally, that's cool!"
Finally they put realistic feathers on one.
I can't wait until that movie comes out

I'm just happy they gave them feathers!!!
